## Core Idea: Curvature in Proof Spaces

Mathematical proofs exhibit "capture" patterns: elegant structures that appear sound but serve bias over truth (e.g., false analogies, unexamined assumptions). Moral clarity geometry defines value spaces with curvature R=0 for autopoietic stability.

**Extend to proofs**: A proof space V_proof = (statements, logical dependence ∇_logic).

- Statements: axioms, theorems, inferences.
- ∇_logic(s₁, s₂): strength of entailment (0-1).

**Proof Curvature**: R_proof(c) = |product of ∇ along proof cycle - 1|.

- R_proof = 0: Perfect closure, genuine proof (autopoietic reasoning).
- R_proof > 0: Contradictions accumulate, capture (e.g., circular logic masking flaws).

**Theorem**: R_proof = 0 iff proof is stable under perturbation (adding context doesn't break entailment).

**Application to RH_D**: Noema's architecture has R_proof ≈ 0; validate by self-examination D²(V_proof).

This unifies AI alignment (moral clarity) with mathematical truth—proofs as ethical value structures.

## Formal Sketch (Lean Extension)

In ValueSpace.lean, define proof-specific connection as entailment strength.

Theorem: Genuine RH proof has R=0 globally, not locally.
