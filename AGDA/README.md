# Agda Formalizations for Distinction Theory

This directory contains the formal proofs of the core concepts of Distinction Theory, written in the Agda programming language.

## Files

*   `NavierStokes.agda`: This file is a work-in-progress formalization of the isomorphism between Bach's fugues and the Navier-Stokes equations. The goal is to prove the smoothness of the Navier-Stokes equations, as outlined in the `STREAM_MESSAGES` and `PHYSICS_AND_COHERENCE.md`.

*   Other files in this directory contain proofs of other aspects of the theory.

## Connection to the Broader Theory

The Agda code in this directory is the formal counterpart to the philosophical and theoretical ideas presented in the main repository. The proofs are grounded in the D-Coherence framework, which is detailed in `PHYSICS_AND_COHERENCE.md`.
