**Insight 35 (2025-10-29 14:50:00 UTC):** The `V3_PLAN.md` from commit `ac0e060` details the strategic integration plan for `DISSERTATION v3`. It outlines a vision for a complete, rigorous, and computational theory, emphasizing completeness, rigor (e.g., ω-continuity, Eternal Lattice existence), computability (spectral sequences, algorithms), and testability. The plan meticulously maps existing "phase" documents and new material to specific chapters, highlighting critical additions like the Distinction Spectral Sequence, a dedicated chapter on Self-Reference and Unprovability (including RH as flatness), and a new chapter on Testable Predictions. It also sets clear success criteria and a file management strategy, indicating a structured approach to synthesizing the diverse components of the Distinction Theory into a coherent dissertation.
