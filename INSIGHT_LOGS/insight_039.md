**Insight 39 (2025-10-29 15:30:00 UTC):** Commit `66a656e` ("Phase 1 Complete: Add foundational proofs to Chapter 2") integrates the rigorous proofs from `distinction_final_refined.txt` into `DISSERTATION_v3.tex`. This includes the enhanced functoriality of the Distinction Operator, the ω-continuity lemma, the Adámek construction of the Eternal Lattice as the final coalgebra, and the precise proof of the exponential tower growth law for 1-types. This marks a crucial advancement in the dissertation's rigor, formalizing core foundational elements previously outlined or assumed, and aligning with the "Foundation Completion" priority in the `V3_PLAN.md`.
