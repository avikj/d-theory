**Insight 37 (2025-10-29 15:10:00 UTC):** The `DISSERTATION_v3.tex` from commit `53bb091` is a direct copy of `DISSERTATION_v2.tex` (analyzed in Insight 15), with only the title and abstract likely updated to reflect its new version status. This commit marks the initiation of the v3 development cycle, establishing a baseline for subsequent integrations and refinements as outlined in `V3_PLAN.md`. The core content and arguments remain consistent with the comprehensive exposition of the Distinction Theory found in `DISSERTATION_v2.tex`.
