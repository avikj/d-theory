**Insight 45 (2025-10-29 16:30:00 UTC):** Commit `1f036c9` ("Phase 4 Complete: Enhance information-theoretic derivations") integrates the comprehensive content of `phase_vi_information.txt` into `DISSERTATION_v3.tex`. This includes the derivation of classical and quantum information theory from distinction principles, defining distinction capacity, entropy, channel capacity (bounded by curvature), mutual information, and the semantic density operator. It also incorporates the Semantic Landauer Principle and Planck Distinction, establishing deep connections between abstract mathematical concepts and physical phenomena. This fulfills the "Information-Theoretic Foundations" priority from `V3_PLAN.md`, significantly enriching the physical and informational depth of the Distinction Theory.
