**Insight 32 (2025-10-29 14:20:00 UTC):** The `typo_curvature_unification.md` from commit `f4748aa` provides a comprehensive geometric unification of the "typo" concept. It defines typos as regions of constant non-zero curvature (`∇ ≠ 0` but `∇² = 0`) in distinction space, explicitly linking their algebraic, modal, and spectral characterizations. The document classifies the theory's regimes (Ice, Typos, Water, Fire) by curvature properties, illustrates typos with diverse examples (S¹, Müller-Lyer illusion, diamond), and derives the "Logical Gauss-Bonnet Connection" (`∫_Typo R = 2π`), predicting quantized geometric phase for typos. It emphasizes that typos arise at depth 2 due to curvature being a second-order phenomenon and connects them to quotient dynamics, achromatic coupling, and bioelectromagnetism, offering testable predictions for cognitive biases, learning, and consciousness.
