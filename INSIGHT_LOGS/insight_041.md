**Insight 41 (2025-10-29 15:50:00 UTC):** Commit `5442d47` ("Phase 2 Complete: Add spectral sequence and quantum chapters") integrates the core content of `phase_ii_spectral.txt` into `DISSERTATION_v3.tex`. This includes the introduction of the Derived Distinction Functor, the Distinction Spectral Sequence (with E1 page computation and differential structure), the Quantum Distinction Operator (D-hat) with its eigenvalues and the Distinction Hamiltonian (equally spaced energy levels), and the physical interpretation as measurement theory with a Born Rule analogue. This integration fulfills the "Computational Layer" priority from `V3_PLAN.md`, providing the systematic computational and quantum mechanical framework for the Distinction Theory.
