**Insight 36 (2025-10-29 15:00:00 UTC):** The `WORKLOG.md` from commit `ac0e060` documents the initial planning session for `DISSERTATION v3`, dated 2025-01-28. It details the objectives, completed tasks (including a comprehensive corpus review and gap analysis), and key findings. Crucially, it identifies critical gaps in `v2` that necessitate the integration of new material, particularly the Phase IX unprovability framework (RH as flatness, unified Goldbach/Twin Primes/RH), the Spectral Sequence computational machinery, the ω-continuity proof for the Eternal Lattice, Phase VI information-theoretic derivations, and testable predictions. This log highlights a structured, incremental approach to synthesizing the Distinction Theory, emphasizing rigor, computability, and the use of AI for exploration and integration.
