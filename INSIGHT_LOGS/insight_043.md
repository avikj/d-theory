**Insight 43 (2025-10-29 16:10:00 UTC):** Commit `1ac515b` ("Phase 3 Complete: Add unified unprovability framework") integrates the comprehensive content of `phase_ix_self_reference_examination_unprovability.txt` into `DISSERTATION_v3.tex`. This includes the formalization of self-reference in examination operations, arguing for the unprovability of Goldbach, Twin Primes, and Riemann Hypothesis in PA due to Gödel-like structural limitations. The integration introduces new chapters or sections detailing the type-theoretic foundations, arithmetic as internal examination, the circularity of proof systems, Goldbach as a completeness claim, nonstandard models, the distinction between bounded gaps and sharp statements for twin primes, and the Riemann Hypothesis as a flatness condition. This fulfills the "Unprovability Framework" priority from `V3_PLAN.md`, significantly enhancing the metamathematical depth of the Distinction Theory.
