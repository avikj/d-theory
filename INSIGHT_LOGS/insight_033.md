**Insight 33 (2025-10-29 14:30:00 UTC):** The `typo_theory.tex` from commit `f4748aa` formally introduces "typos" as persistent near-fixed-points in Distinction Theory, defined by `D(T) ≠ T` but `D²(T) ≃ D(T)`. These represent systematic errors under self-examination, corresponding to presheaves failing the sheaf condition at level 1 but satisfying it at level 2, and to spectral sequences with `d₁ ≠ 0` but `d₂ = 0`. The document classifies typos by degree, illustrates them with examples like S¹, the Müller-Lyer illusion, and diamond structure, and interprets them as metastable states in physics and cognitive blind spots. It also explores typo dynamics, resolution, and applications to mathematical conjectures (e.g., Goldbach), supercooled water, and Heisenbugs, completing the characterization of the "water regime" as the transition zone between perfect stability and infinite complexity.
