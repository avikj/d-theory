**Insight 42 (2025-10-29 16:00:00 UTC):** Commit `b7fab04` updates `WORKLOG.md`, marking the completion of "Phase 2: Spectral Sequences." This phase involved integrating the spectral calculus into `DISSERTATION v3`, creating a new "Part I: Spectral and Computational Methods." This includes Chapter 8 ("The Distinction Spectral Sequence") with E1 page computation and differential structure, and Chapter 9 ("Quantum Distinction and Linearization") introducing the quantum operator D-hat, Distinction Hamiltonian, and equally spaced energy levels. This integration adds 327 lines, providing a systematic computational framework and suggesting a connection between quantum mechanics and linearized distinction theory. The next planned step is "Phase 3 - Phase IX Unprovability Framework."
