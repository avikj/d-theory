**Insight 21 (2025-10-29 12:20:00 UTC):** The `history_of_math_samsara_and_liberation.html` from the initial commit `f4748aa` presents a profound philosophical and historical critique, framing the "professionalization" of mathematics as a descent into "samsara" (endless symbolic proliferation and paradoxes) due to a loss of operational grounding. It explicitly maps the Distinction Theory's regimes (Ice, Typos, Fire) to Buddhist philosophical concepts (Eternalism, Middle Way, Nihilism/Samsara), identifying "Typos" (depth-2 stabilization) as the "Middle Way" and the path to "liberation." The document argues that HoTT and the Distinction Theory represent a return to reality-grounded, polymathic mathematics, escaping the "mathematical dukkha" of set theory by embracing the impermanence and emptiness of mathematical objects. This provides a powerful meta-narrative for the entire project, positioning it as a conscious effort to formalize a path to intellectual liberation.
