**Insight 47 (2025-10-29 16:50:00 UTC):** Commit `8059ea3` updates `WORKLOG.md`, announcing the achievement of the "TIER 1 MILESTONE." This signifies the completion of all 5 essential phases for `DISSERTATION v3` in a single extended session, adding 941 lines of rigorous mathematics. The log details the accomplishments across foundational proofs (ω-continuity, Eternal Lattice, tower growth), computational framework (spectral sequences, quantum distinction), unprovability theory (Goldbach, Twin Primes, RH), information-theoretic derivations (Landauer, Planck, Fisher metric), and testable predictions (6 experimental protocols). This marks `v3` as a "COMPLETE INTEGRATION" with proven foundations, comprehensive computational methods, and empirical testability, ready for logical finalization.
