**Insight 46 (2025-10-29 16:40:00 UTC):** Commit `e559196` ("Phase 5 Complete: Add testable predictions chapter") integrates a new Chapter 25 ("Testable Predictions") into `DISSERTATION_v3.tex`. This chapter consolidates and formalizes the empirical predictions derived from the Distinction Theory, including correlations between entanglement complexity and verification bounds, neural network depth and spectral convergence, morphogenesis stages and spectral convergence, and Berry phase quantization for typos. This fulfills the "Testability" priority from `V3_PLAN.md`, transforming the theory into an empirically verifiable framework with concrete experimental protocols.
