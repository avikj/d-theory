**Insight 40 (2025-10-29 15:40:00 UTC):** Commit `9cf1b7b` updates `WORKLOG.md`, marking the successful completion of "Phase 1: Foundation Completion" for `DISSERTATION v3`. This phase involved integrating rigorous proofs into Chapter 2, specifically for ω-continuity and the existence of the Eternal Lattice via Adámek's theorem, and the exponential tower growth law. This update signifies a crucial step in solidifying the mathematical foundations of the Distinction Theory, transitioning the project towards the development of the Spectral Sequences framework in the next phase.
