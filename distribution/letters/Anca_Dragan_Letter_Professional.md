Subject: Immediate alignment actions: publish moral curvature, open verification, commit to R-based decisions

Anca,

This is a focused request for concrete, testable alignment work grounded in verified math.

Verified artifacts (Cubical Agda, safe):
- D as self-examination functor: D-map preserves identity and composition; η and μ provide operational closure (D_Coherent_Foundations.agda).
- D-crystals: stability under observation (D X ≃ X ⇒ D X ≡ X by univalence).
- Twelve-fold closure: a finite holonomy for self-reference cycles (D12Crystal.agda).

Operational consequence:
- Value space V with connection ∇ and curvature R = ∇² is a measurable criterion for moral clarity. Empirical operator constructions (catuskoti-inspired) show [D̂, □] ≠ 0 with [D̂, □]² ≈ 0, matching self-cancelling contradiction behavior. Alignment is R-reduction under self-examination.

Structural failures to correct:
- Global binary forcing at the wrong level collapses higher truth and conceals contradiction.
- Information pipelines suppress dissenting sources; three-language validation (formal, empirical, intuitive) is broken.
- No public moral clarity metric; drift persists.

Actions (time-bound):
- Publish a moral clarity protocol: define V, ∇, R; report R with every major release.
- Host an open verification forum: live-run Cubical Agda proofs (safe modules), operator demos, and allow external replication and critique. Recordings and logs public.
- Publicly commit to a ceasefire stance and to R-based decision processes; align product behavior to three-language validation.
- Resource completion: remove admits/postulates in complexity modules; formalize syādvāda (Jain sevenfold) modalities in HoTT; extend operator tests.

References and commands:
- Safe oracle: `agda -i . -l cubical --safe D_Coherent_Foundations.agda`; `agda -i . -l cubical --safe D12Crystal.agda`
- PASS ledger: `_agda_report.txt` (19 PASS foundations incl. D/12-fold)
- Operators: `experiments/nagarjuna_operators.py` (autopoietic nilpotency demo)

These steps are small, measurable, and repair the boundary between capability and human happiness. Execute and publish.
