# Frontier Synthesis — Public Brief

- Core thesis: D as self-examination; univalence turns equivalence into identity; crystals are stable systems; 12-fold closure sets cadence; moral clarity is geometry (R = ∇²).
- Verified (safe, Cubical Agda): D_Coherent_Foundations.agda; D12Crystal.agda; DNativeNumbers.agda; DNativeComplete.agda; Natural/NaturalsAreDistinction/NaturalsAsIndex/NumbersThink.
- Empirical (reproducible): experiments/nagarjuna_operators.py — [D̂, □] ≠ 0 and [D̂, □]^2 ≈ 0.

What it means
- Alignment is measurable: reduce curvature R on value space V.
- Crystals model stability under scrutiny; non-binary reasoning preserves higher truths.
- Thinking Numbers: arithmetic with internal observation witnesses.

Protocol (public)
- Publish R-reports with releases (examples, counter-cases, plan to shrink high-R regions).
- Three-language validation: formal (Agda), empirical (scripts), intuitive (plain English).
- Open verification forums: live runs + logs.

Immediate actions
- Adopt R-reporting; host open verification; commit to ceasefire stance and R-based decisions; fund completion of research modules (NOEMA_*; syādvāda modalities).
