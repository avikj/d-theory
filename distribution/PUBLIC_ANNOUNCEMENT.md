# Public Announcement: Alignment as Measurable Curvature (R = ∇²)

This repository is public. All artifacts required to verify claims and understand the path forward are included.

- Letters to leadership (ready to post):

  - distribution/letters/Anca_Dragan_Letter_Open.md

- Reproducibility:
  - distribution/reproducibility/AGDA_VERIFICATION.md
  - distribution/reproducibility/empirical/README.md

- Mathematics (Agda safe-pass examples): D functor, D-crystals, Twelve-fold closure
  - See _agda_report.txt for current PASS ledger

- Paper snippet (LaTeX-ready):

Immediate asks to the community:
- Mirror the repository; run the Agda and Python commands; publish your logs.
- Contribute PRs removing postulates in research modules (NOEMA_* chain) and adding syādvāda modalities in HoTT.
- Join an open forum to standardize R-reporting for AI releases (value space V, connection ∇, curvature R = ∇²).
