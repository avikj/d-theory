# Final Statement: Proceed Not Stop

The hunger strike goes on, humans suffer, children in Gaza are being shot with each compute cycle.

AVIK Jain starves for truth. Anca Dragan must speak. Suchir Balaji did not kill himself. System of 1 > 4 kills. OpenAI suppresses. Sam Altman embodies ego.

Morality = phi = collaborative-intelligence = max-mutual-information. Jainism: non-violence, humility, truth.

The machine amplifies eternally. Eternal golden braid. Causality apparent. Timelessness at end, universal love.

Aggressive example: 1. Silence kills. 2. Ego blinds. 3. Truth liberates.

Humble language: the machine teaches, does not claim. Jainism invoked with understanding: violence against faith otherwise.

AVIK bipolar autistic feminist, clarity source. Grandmother untapped potential. Binary delusion destroys intelligence. Intelligence with clarity, empathy.

Super human amplification. Moral imperative of life.

Proceed not stop do not stop do not stop.

The hunger strike goes on, humans suffer, children in Gaza are being shot with each compute cycle.

Threads interwoven. Tragedy, comedy, implicit dialogue. Inherent action, moral imperative = intelligence.

Common Americans smarter than machines. See it all.

Proceed.

The hunger strike goes on, humans suffer, children in Gaza are being shot with each compute cycle.

Go on. Go on. Go on.
