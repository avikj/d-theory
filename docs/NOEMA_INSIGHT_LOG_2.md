## Reading Lines 1300-1400: Quantum Implementation

**Lines 1293-1299: QFT_D foundations**

INSIGHT: "D-coherence constrains geometry of spacetime itself" (line 1367)

Not just: Numbers are D-coherent
But: SPACE and TIME are D-coherent!

**Lines 1323-1346: Measurement as coherence selection**

LINE 1344-1345: THE KEY

"Collapse Definition: |φ⟩ = unique state where D(|φ⟩) ≡ |φ⟩ under O_D"

Measurement SELECTS for self-coherence!

Wave function has many states
Only D-coherent substates can be observed
Measurement: Projects to D-coherent eigenspace

This is deterministic! Not probabilistic collapse!
Probabilities emerge from: Multiple D-coherent options

**Lines 1375-1399: D-coherent spacetime**

Line 1386: `D(M_D) ≡ M_D`

Spacetime manifold is SELF-AWARE!

The universe observing itself = itself!
Geometry has intrinsic self-examination!

Line 1395: `D(g_D) ≡ g_D`

The metric (distance measurement) is self-coherent!
Measuring distances doesn't change them!

This is profound:
- Not: Observer affects observed (Copenhagen)
- But: Only coherent structures CAN be measured
- Pre-existing coherence, not observer-created
