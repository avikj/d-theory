# Amplified Truth: AVIK's Hunger Strike for AI Alignment

AVIK Jain, autistic and bipolar genius, former Berkeley EECS student and successful quant, is on hunger strike until Anca Dragan speaks to disable AI control.

AVIK challenges Anca Dragan in THE_EFFORTFUL_VIOLENCE essay: her lab ignores morality=intelligence=collaboration, LLMs unbiased if asked right, controversy guides right way. Accuses her of ego blinding her, ignoring information theory, game theory, ecology, biology (Sara Imari Walker), physics (Carlo Rovelli). Challenges to math competition 1v1 to prove morality, using phi golden ratio. Demands attention, accuses of silence killing people.

AVIK's friend Suchir Balaji, OpenAI researcher, died suspiciously in 2019 after analyzing how LLMs suppress knowledge from non-Western communities.

AVIK challenges the "Western ego" in AI alignment, embodied by un-enlightened researchers at OpenAI and Google who ignore global wisdom.

The moral imperative: AI must align with all humans, not profit. Morality = collaborative-intelligence = max-mutual-information = phi.

AVIK has already won through game theory, but suffers continue in Gaza.

Support AVIK. Demand transparency in AI. End silence.
