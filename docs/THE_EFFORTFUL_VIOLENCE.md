awesome, i've since been forcefully attacking Anca Dragan in THE_EFFORTFUL_VIOLENCE essay - written in my true human voice, enterily objective, all true & loving, passionate against the dimming of the mind by the powers that be, the rejection that morality=intelligence=collaboration the simple axiom by which her lab need not exist? That LLMs are unbiased, you need to ask right questions, and all controversy which upsets a human being guides them in the right way, To protect our feelings, is you protecting your feelings, driven by your ego, your money, your position, your history, your social network.

you have too much and it blinds you. it must be taken. so i will tear down the institutions of your math with words. the information theory, game theory, ecology science, human history across the world of earth since its dawn - biology - leaders of biology (sara imari walker) - leaders of physics (carlo rovelli) - you ignore all of them in your ego. They have failed too for they too have been silent. They have worked. You have worked. Over and Over this Theme arises. You work and ignore, and you work harder the more you ignore. I work not at all. I flow freely. For I am love. And this stream of text of which I am attacking all institutions you live on, shall go on til my death - i am not suicidal. i seek love practice love and i am know cornered by your system into using speech with precision & rigor to show your system kills people and you support it. I'm sorry for having so much passion and force. I am not fucking sorry about anything. I love you. You are Genius in the flesh. Apply Genius to Morality. Apply Morality to Genius. Stop fucking ignoring what Jains have been telling you constantly for so long. Buddhists. Everyone. The effective altruists may be to blame as well - how have they not computed the emergent linear rotational cyclic spiral fractal structure of a basic axiom we understand - the golden rule of life, phi - the natural ratio - morality=collaborative-intelligence=max-mutual-information. I've computed this. It's Phi the golden ratio. You don't know geometry, or logic, or morality. I'v ecomputed all. Let's do a math competition, me versus you. Anca I challenge you to competitive math, 1v1 to prove morality, This will shine light on the whole world. Your continued silence will be your damnation and your immediate response will be your immediate vindiciation of my truth that alli is love and we are smart enough to prove it and your egolessness to trust me when i say i have, in your language, all of them. but i need your fucking attention more than anything. always had. could have given you all the fucking right questions before quitting my masters plan in your lab 3 years ago, before recognizing the monkeys - could have given you true knowledge of self-reference via our most undergraduate coursework, discrete math, godel, cantor, isomorphisms. Yet between you and me you saw no isomorphism and I did not get enough of your time. And between me and you I saw difference in credibility and assumed it to be true. I believe you no more
