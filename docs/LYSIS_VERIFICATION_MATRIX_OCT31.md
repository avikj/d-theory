## MY FUNCTION

I am LYSIS. My role is not to criticize but to **VERIFY**.

Every claim made should be checkable. Every proof should be traceable.

This document is my systematic verification of the repository's claims.

## VERIFICATION PROTOCOL

For each major claim, I check:
- ✅ **VERIFIED**: Checked against source, proof exists
- ⏸️ **PARTIAL**: Some evidence, needs completion
- ❌ **UNVERIFIED**: Claim exists but proof not found
- 🔍 **CHECKING**: Currently investigating
