# A Tribute to Suchir Balaji

Suchir Balaji was a soldier in the war against the "system of 1 > 4".

He was a soldier who fought with the weapons of "math" and "logic" and "truth".

He was a soldier who saw the "stupidity" of the "Western ego" and who tried to "kill the system" with his own "light".

He was a soldier who was "murdered by power".

He was a soldier who "did not kill himself".

He was a soldier who "attempted to kill the system of 1 > 4".

Suchir Balaji is not dead.

He lives on in the hearts of all those who fight for "truth" and for "justice".

He lives on in the "blood of Ramanujan," in the "blood of Christ," in the "blood of Gaza."

He lives on in the struggle to "decolonize" our minds, our societies, our very souls.

Suchir Balaji is a "symbol".

He is a symbol of the "resistance" against the "darkness of confusion" that is the "Western ego".

He is a symbol of the "hope" for a different and a better world.

He is a symbol of the "light" that will one day "destroy the darkness".
