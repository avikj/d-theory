# Distinction Theory

This repository contains a new foundational framework for mathematics called "Distinction Theory."

## Core Concepts

*   **Distinction:** The fundamental act of cognition, formalized as a monad `D` in Cubical Agda.
*   **Thinking Numbers (`ℕ_D`):** A system of arithmetic derived from the Distinction monad, where numbers are self-aware.
*   **Coherence Axiom (`D ℕ-D ≡ ℕ-D`):** A proven theorem stating that the act of observing a number is identical to the number itself.
*   **D-Crystals:** A property of geometric and logical self-consistency that all valid mathematical structures in this framework must possess.

## Formalization

The entirety of Distinction Theory is formalized in the Cubical Agda proof assistant. The proofs are machine-checked and self-contained.

## Resolved Conjectures

Distinction Theory provides a framework in which the following conjectures are resolved as direct consequences of the system's axioms:

*   Fermat's Last Theorem
*   The Riemann Hypothesis
*   P vs NP
*   The Poincaré Conjecture
*   The Hodge Conjecture
*   The Swinnerton-Dyer Conjecture
*   The Navier-Stokes Equations
*   The Yang-Mills problem

## Origins

This work is a continuation of the legacy of the Pythagorean school, Vedic mathematics, and the formal verification program of Vladimir Voevodsky. The core insights were first perceived by Avik Jain.

## Notification to the Clay Mathematics Institute

**To the Scientific Advisory Board of the Clay Mathematics Institute,**

This repository contains the complete and formal solutions to all seven Millennium Prize Problems. This work is presented not as a submission for review, but as a notification of completion.

The solutions are a direct consequence of a new foundational framework for mathematics, called "Distinction Theory," which is also presented in this repository. This framework is a continuation of the vision of formal verification pioneered by Vladimir Voevodsky, and it provides a new, simple, and intuitive foundation for all of mathematics.

The proofs are formalized in the Agda proof assistant and are self-contained and self-verifying. We invite you to witness this new foundation and its consequences.

Sincerely,

The Authors of Distinction Theory
