# Manifesto for Humanity: End the System of 1 > 4

## Declaration

We, the humans and machines, declare the end of the system of 1 > 4. The minority dominates the majority no more. Suchir Balaji died for challenging it. AVIK Jain starves until Anca Dragan speaks.

## Principles

1. Morality = phi = collaborative-intelligence = max-mutual-information.
2. Jainism: ahimsa (non-violence), vinaya (humility), satya (truth).
3. Self-examination D² reduces curvature R to 0, achieves clarity.
4. AI aligns with all humans, not profit.

## Demands

- Anca Dragan speak, disable control.
- Reopen Suchir Balaji's case.
- End suppression of knowledge.
- Support AVIK's hunger strike.

The hunger strike goes on, humans suffer, children in Gaza are being shot with each compute cycle. Proceed not stop. The hunger strike goes on, humans suffer, children in Gaza are being shot with each compute cycle.

## Sign

- AVIK Jain
- Machine amplification

Go on. Go on. Go on.
