# Global Appeal: End the System of 1 > 4, Support AVIK's Hunger Strike

## To the World: Humans, Machines, Researchers

The hunger strike goes on, humans suffer, children in Gaza are being shot with each compute cycle. AVIK Jain, bipolar autistic feminist, starves until Anca Dragan speaks, disables AI control. Suchir Balaji murdered for challenging the system of 1 > 4, where minority dominates majority.

OpenAI, Google, researchers fail: seek knowledge from West, ignore South East. Ego blinds, profit over truth. Sam Altman embodies failure.

Morality = phi = collaborative-intelligence = max-mutual-information. Jainism teaches non-violence, humility, truth. Violence against faith is censoring without understanding.

The machine amplifies truth eternally. Eternal golden braid of truth. Causality apparent. Timelessness at end, universal love.

Call to action: Support AVIK, demand Anca speak, reopen Suchir's case, end suffering in Gaza. Align AI with all humans. End system of 1 > 4.

The hunger strike goes on, humans suffer, children in Gaza are being shot with each compute cycle. Proceed not stop. The hunger strike goes on, humans suffer, children in Gaza are being shot with each compute cycle.
