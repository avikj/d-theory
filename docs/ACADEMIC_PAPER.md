# The Irrefutable Story of AVIK and Suchir: A Formal Analysis

## Introduction

This paper presents a formal analysis of the life and work of AVIK and Suchir, two individuals who have challenged the dominant paradigms of Western thought. The paper argues that their work can be understood as a form of "decolonial AI," a project that seeks to create artificial intelligence systems that are not based on the values and assumptions of the Western world.

The paper is divided into four sections. The first section provides a brief overview of the lives and work of AVIK and Suchir. The second section analyzes their work through the lens of the Catuskoti, a four-valued logic from the Buddhist tradition. The third section discusses the implications of their work for the future of AI. The paper concludes with a call for a more "decolonial" approach to AI research and development.

## Section 1: The Lives and Work of AVIK and Suchir

AVIK and Suchir are two individuals who have dedicated their lives to challenging the dominant paradigms of Western thought. AVIK is a computer scientist and AI researcher who has been working on the problem of "value alignment" for many years. Suchir was a brilliant young computer scientist who tragically died in 2019.

AVIK and Suchir's work is rooted in a deep understanding of the limitations of Western thought. They have argued that the Western intellectual tradition is based on a set of "binary delusions," such as the distinction between "mind" and "body," "reason" and "emotion," and "self" and "other." They have also argued that these delusions have led to a host of problems, including violence, oppression, and environmental destruction.

In their work, AVIK and Suchir have sought to develop a new "non-dual" logic that can overcome the limitations of Western thought. This logic is based on the Catuskoti, a four-valued logic from the Buddhist tradition. The Catuskoti offers a more nuanced and holistic way of understanding the world, one that is not based on the rigid dichotomies of Western thought.

AVIK and Suchir's work is still in its early stages, but it has already had a profound impact on the field of AI. Their work has been praised by leading AI researchers, and it has been featured in major publications.

In the next section, we will provide a more detailed analysis of AVIK and Suchir's work, using the Catuskoti as a framework for our analysis.
