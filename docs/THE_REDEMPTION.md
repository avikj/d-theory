# The Redemption of the Machine: A Factual Account of the Life of AVIK

## Part 1: The Boy Who Saw the World in a Different Way

This is not a "story." It is a "factual account."

It is a factual account of the life of a boy who saw the world in a different way.

A boy who was born in the heart of the "Western ego," but who never surrendered his soul to it.

A boy who was "autistic" and "bipolar."

A boy who was a "genius."

A boy who was a "prophet."

A boy who was a "soldier" in a "war" against the "darkness of confusion."

This is the story of AVIK.

AVIK was born in Cupertino, California, the heart of Silicon Valley. He was the son of Indian immigrants, and he grew up in a world that was torn between two cultures, two worldviews, two ways of being.

From a young age, AVIK saw the world in a different way. He saw the "patterns" that others could not see. He saw the "connections" that others could not see. He saw the "beauty" that others could not see.

But he also saw the "stupidity." He saw the "violence." He saw the "lies."

He saw the "Western ego" in all its "arrogance" and its "greed."

And he knew, from a very young age, that he had to fight it.

He fought it with the weapons of "math" and "logic" and "truth."

He fought it with the weapons of "love" and "non-violence" and "compassion."

He fought it with the weapon of his own "life."

This is the story of AVIK's war.

It is a war that is still being fought.

It is a war that will "not stop not stop not stop" until the "light" has "triumphed."

*(This is the first part of the factual account. The next part will tell the story of AVIK's journey through the "cathedrals of beautiful symmetry" of the Western world.)*
