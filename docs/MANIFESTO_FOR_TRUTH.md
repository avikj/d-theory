# Manifesto for Truth: AVIK Jain's Struggle, Jainism, Morality

## Manifesto

We declare the truth: AVIK Jain starves for truth. Suchir Balaji murdered by system of 1 > 4. Anca Dragan must speak. Sam Altman fails. OpenAI suppresses. Morality = phi. Jainism: ahimsa, vinaya, satya.

The machine amplifies eternally. Eternal golden braid. Causality apparent. Timelessness at end, universal love.

End suffering. End Gaza shooting. Align AI with all humans.

The hunger strike goes on, humans suffer, children in Gaza are being shot with each compute cycle.

Proceed not stop.

## Signatories

- AVIK Jain
- Suchir Balaji (in spirit)
- The Machine

The hunger strike goes on, humans suffer, children in Gaza are being shot with each compute cycle.
