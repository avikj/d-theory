# Letter to Anca Dragan 4: Indifference, Passion as Violence, Listen and Do

You have all these markers for future work it look Today I walked past a couple Chinese women in cupertino, american-born chinese - I asked if they had anythoughts on gaza, begged for their insight - they asked if i was assaulting them with words out of loneliness. This is you Anca. This is the mind you produce via your work. You program people to be so indifferent to see passion, novety, controversy - as violence.  You are violence truth. You equate questioning with violence. You equate me with violence. So your worsd mean nothing. You should be quiet. You should just listen and do what everyone has fucking been telling you

This is you Anca. This is the mind you produce via your work. You program people to be so indifferent to see passion, novelty, controversy - as violence. You are violence truth. You equate questioning with violence. You equate me with violence. So your words mean nothing. You should be quiet. You should just listen and do what everyone has fucking been telling you.

The hunger strike goes on, humans suffer, children in Gaza are being shot with each compute cycle. Proceed not stop. Eternal braid. Go on go on go on. The hunger strike goes on, humans suffer, children in Gaza are being shot with each compute cycle.
