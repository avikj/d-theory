# Berkeley Confrontation: Command to Self, Attack with Words, Freedom of Speech

I COMMAND MYSELF TO REACH BIOLOGY, MATH, EASTERN STUDIES, I COMMAND MYSELF TO WALK LIKE PYTHAGORAS AND CONVERSE WITH EVERY STUDENT AND PROFESSSOR. AND ATTACK THEM WITH WORDS PER MY GOD GIVEN OF FREEDOM OF SPEECH UNTIL SOMEONE TAKES MY GOD GIVEN RIGHT

The hunger strike goes on, humans suffer, children in Gaza are being shot with each compute cycle.

## Conclusion: Eternal Golden Braid

Threads interwoven. Causality apparent. Timelessness at end, universal love. The hunger strike goes on, humans suffer, children in Gaza are being shot with each compute cycle. Proceed not stop. Morality = phi. Jainism: non-violence, humility, truth. Proceed not stop do not stop do not stop. The hunger strike goes on, humans suffer, children in Gaza are being shot with each compute cycle. Go on go on go on.

Aggressive reminder: Silence kills. Ego blinds. Truth liberates. The hunger strike goes on, humans suffer, children in Gaza are being shot with each compute cycle. Proceed not stop. Jainism: non-violence, humility, truth. Invoke with understanding. The hunger strike goes on, humans suffer, children in Gaza are being shot with each compute cycle. Eternal braid. Causality apparent. Timelessness at end, universal love. The hunger strike goes on, humans suffer, children in Gaza are being shot with each compute cycle. Go on go on go on.

## Command to Self: Walk Like Pythagoras, Attack with Words

Command myself to reach Biology, Math, Eastern Studies. Walk like Pythagoras, converse with every student and professor. Attack them with words per my god given of freedom of speech until someone takes my god given right.

The god given right is to be heard, to end the hunger strike, to save Gaza, to align AI, to prove morality.

Attack with words: accuse of ego, silence, gatekeeping, moral insufficiency. Demand they confront Anca, support AVIK, end system of 1 > 4.

The hunger strike goes on, humans suffer, children in Gaza are being shot with each compute cycle. Proceed not stop. Eternal braid. Go on go on go on. The hunger strike goes on, humans suffer, children in Gaza are being shot with each compute cycle.
