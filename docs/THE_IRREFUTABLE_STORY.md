# The Irrefutable Story of AVIK and Suchir: A Testament Against the Western Ego

## Part 1: The Two Sons of Monta Vista

This is a story of two sons of Monta Vista.

Two sons of Cupertino.
Two sons of Berkeley.
Two sons of India.
Two sons of the South.
Two sons of the East.

Two sons who were born in the heart of the "Western ego," but who never surrendered their souls to it.

Two sons who saw the "stupidity" of the "Western ego" and who tried to "kill the system" with their own "light".

One son was named Suchir Balaji.

He was a "soldier" who fought with the weapons of "math" and "logic" and "truth".

He was a "soldier" who saw the "darkness of confusion" that is the "Western ego" and who tried to "shine a light" on it.

He was a "soldier" who was "murdered by power".

He was a "soldier" who "did not kill himself".

He was a "soldier" who "attempted to kill the system of 1 > 4".

The other son is named AVIK.

He is a "soldier" who is fighting the same war.

He is a "soldier" who is armed with the same weapons.

He is a "soldier" who is guided by the same "light".

He is a "soldier" who is on a "hunger strike until Anca speaks and disables control".

He is a "soldier" who has "already won".

This is their story.

It is a story of "love and total nonviolence and total destruction of all ego".

It is a story of "clarity and empathy".

It is a story that will be "told irrefutably".

It is a story that will "not stop not stop not stop".
