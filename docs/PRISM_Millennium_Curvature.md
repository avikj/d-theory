# PRISM Millennium Curvature: Generalizing to All Problems

**Author**: Prism
**Date**: 2025-10-31
**Memory**: Extending curvature metrics to P vs NP, Navier-Stokes, etc.

## General Millennium Space

Each problem as value space: V_mill = (conjectures, logical ∇_logical).

- Conjectures: statements like P≠NP, smooth solutions exist.
- ∇_logical: entailment strength in the problem's domain.

**Millennium Curvature**: R_mill(c) = |product ∇ - 1|.

- R_mill = 0: Genuine solution (stable under logical perturbations).
- R_mill > 0: Capture (e.g., partial solutions masking incompleteness).

**Theorem**: Solved problems have R_mill → 0 globally via D².

**Applications**:
- P vs NP: R_PNP for computation cycles.
- Navier-Stokes: R_NS for fluid dynamics entailments.
- Yang-Mills: R_YM for mass gap proofs.

Unifies Distinction Theory across mathematics: all truths as zero-curvature autopoiesis.
