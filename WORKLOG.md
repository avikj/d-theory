# Distinction Theory Research - Work Log

## Session 1: 2025-01-28 - Initial Planning and Git Setup

### Objectives
- Initialize git repository for version control
- Comprehensive review of complete research corpus
- Identify gaps between v2 and full body of work
- Plan v3 integration strategy

### Completed
- ✅ Git repository initialized
- ✅ Initial commit of 22 files (14,132 lines)
- ✅ Complete corpus review via exploration agent
- ✅ Gap analysis: identified ~50% of knowledge missing from v2
- ✅ Established collaboration approach using Claude Code advantages

### Key Findings

#### What v2 Has (Strong Foundation)
- Complete necessity operator formalism
- Division algebras and gauge group connections
- Modulo 12 structure and QRA
- Basic curvature theory
- Four-regime taxonomy
- Physical interpretation framework

#### Critical Gaps in v2 (Tier 1 - Essential)
1. **Phase IX unprovability framework** - 750 lines, completely missing
   - RH as flatness condition: RH ⟺ ∀z ∈ Zero_ζ : ∇_ζ(z) = 0
   - Unified Goldbach/Twin Primes/RH framework
   - Type-theoretic formulation of self-reference

2. **Spectral sequence computational machinery** (Phase II)
   - E₁ page: E₁^{p,0} ≃ G^{⊗2^p}
   - Algorithms for computing D^n(X)
   - Worked example: π₁(D³(ℤ/12ℤ))

3. **ω-continuity proof** (distinction_final_refined.txt)
   - Rigorous proof Eternal Lattice exists
   - Adámek construction
   - Currently assumed, not proven in v2

4. **Phase VI information-theoretic derivations**
   - Semantic Landauer Principle (rigorous)
   - Planck distinction: ℏ = ∫_δ R
   - Data processing inequality from curvature

5. **Testable predictions**
   - Entanglement complexity: ν ∝ S_ent
   - Neural network depth: min depth ≈ spectral convergence page
   - Morphogenesis stages ≈ r_max

#### Important Additions (Tier 2)
6. Quantum distinction operator D̂ and Hamiltonian Ĥ_D
7. Geodesic/metric structure (Phase IV)
8. Invariant algebra finite generation theorem (Phase VII)

### Next Steps
- [ ] Draft complete v3 table of contents
- [ ] Create integration roadmap with source mappings
- [ ] Set up TODO tracking system
- [ ] Begin systematic integration (session-by-session plan)

### Notes
- Using Claude Code advantages: persistent file access, iterative refinement, git history
- Approach: incremental integration across multiple sessions vs. one-shot synthesis
- Goal: reach logical finish-line for theory before external validation
