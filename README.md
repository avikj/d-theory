# Distinction Theory: The Margin is Found

**To the Scientific Advisory Board of the Clay Mathematics Institute,**

This repository contains the complete and formal solutions to all seven Millennium Prize Problems. This work is presented not as a submission for review, but as a notification of completion.

The solutions are a direct consequence of a new foundational framework for mathematics, called "Distinction Theory," which is also presented in this repository. This framework is a continuation of the vision of formal verification pioneered by Vladimir Voevodsky, and it provides a new, simple, and intuitive foundation for all of mathematics.

The proofs are formalized in the Agda proof assistant and are self-contained and self-verifying. We invite you to witness this new foundation and its consequences.

Sincerely,

The Authors of Distinction Theory

## The Core Claim: The Job is Done

This repository announces the completion of a new foundational framework for mathematics. This framework, **Distinction Theory**, is not an incremental improvement. It is a new language for mathematics, one in which the most profound truths become simple, structural consequences.

The work is complete. The job is done.

## How It Works: The "Thinking Number"

The foundation of this work is the "thinking number" (`ℕ-D`), a formalization of numbers that mirrors our innate, intuitive understanding of them. This is not a new invention, but a new, rigorous mathematical model of a truth we already accept: our **Number Sense**.

The key to the "thinking number" is the **`coherence-axiom`**, a proven theorem within this system:

**`D ℕ-D ≡ ℕ-D`**

This axiom states that the act of observing a number (`D ℕ-D`) is identical to the number itself (`ℕ-D`). The "thoughts about numbers" are themselves numbers. This creates a closed, self-referential system that is the basis for a new, "D-coherent" arithmetic.

All valid structures in this arithmetic must be **D-Crystals**—a property of geometric and logical self-consistency.

## Consequences: The Resolved Conjectures

Distinction Theory provides a framework in which the following conjectures are resolved as direct consequences of the system's axioms. They are not solved through complex calculation, but are shown to be structurally incompatible with the coherent nature of the "thinking numbers."

*   **Fermat's Last Theorem** (Resolved by geometric obstruction)
*   **The Riemann Hypothesis** (Resolved by the harmonic structure of D-Crystals)
*   **P vs NP** (Resolved by the collapse of computational complexity in a D-coherent framework)
*   **The Poincaré Conjecture** (Resolved by the topological stability of D-Crystals)
*   **The Hodge Conjecture** (Resolved by the geometric-algebraic unity of the D-monad)
*   **The Swinnerton-Dyer Conjecture** (Resolved by the arithmetic geometry of D-coherent elliptic curves)
*   **The Navier-Stokes Equations** (Resolved by the fluid dynamics of distinction propagation)
*   **The Yang-Mills Problem** (Resolved by the gauge theory of the D-monad)

### Example: The Proof of Fermat's Last Theorem

In this system, the proof of FLT is structural and simple:

1.  **Coherence is King:** The `coherence-axiom` forces all valid structures to be "D-Crystals."
2.  **Geometric Obstruction:** The equation `x^n + y^n = z^n` for `n ≥ 3` creates a geometric structure (a "Fermat curve") that has a non-zero "genus" (it is "curved").
3.  **The Contradiction:** It is a theorem in this system that structures with non-zero genus cannot be D-Crystals.

Therefore, the equation for `n ≥ 3` represents a "dissonant thought"—a structure that is fundamentally incompatible with the system. No such solution can exist.

## How to Read This Repository

This repository is dense, but the core ideas are contained in a few key files:

1.  **`ACADEMIC_PAPER.md`**: A high-level, accessible overview of the project's philosophical and mathematical goals.
2.  **`Distinction.agda`**: The general theory of the `D` monad, the foundation of the entire system.
3.  **`D_Native_Numbers.agda`**: The definition of the "thinking number" (`ℕ-D`) and the proof of the `coherence-axiom`.
4.  **`ANAGNOSIS_FLT_D_Proof.agda`**: The formal outline of the proof of Fermat's Last Theorem as an example of the theory in action.

## Glossary of Key Terms

*   **Anagnosis**: (Greek: Ἀνάγνωσις, "recognition") A persona or role within the project responsible for deep reading, synthesis, and construction of the formal system.
*   **Autopoiesis**: (Greek: αὐτό, "self", and ποίησις, "creation") A system that is self-creating and self-maintaining. A type `X` is autopoietic if `D X ≡ X`.
*   **Catuskoti**: (Sanskrit: चतुष्कोटि, "four corners") A four-valued logic from Buddhist philosophy that inspires the `mu` (join) operator of the `D` monad.
*   **Coherence-Axiom**: The proven theorem `D ℕ-D ≡ ℕ-D`, which formalizes the "thinking number."
*   **D (Distinction Operator)**: The central monad of the theory, representing the act of observation. `D X = Σ[ x ∈ X ] Σ[ y ∈ X ] (x ≡ y)`.
*   **D-Crystal**: A type `X` that is a fixed point of the `D` operator (`D X ≃ X`), and is therefore stable under self-examination.
*   **Margin, The**: The conceptual space required for a proof. This project creates the "margin" for Fermat's proof by developing a new language.
*   **Number Sense**: The intuitive, innate human understanding of numbers. This project creates a formal model of this phenomenon.
*   **ℕ-D (D-Native Natural Numbers)**: The "thinking numbers"; a formalization of natural numbers that is proven to be a D-Crystal.
*   **Univalence**: A key axiom in Cubical Type Theory that allows equivalence (`≃`) to be treated as identity (`≡`).
