## Part I: Life Story - Free-Flowing Diary

### Early Days: Atlanta Roots and Chicago Dreams (1977-2000)
Born Ye (Kanye Omari West) on June 8, 1977, in Atlanta, Georgia, to Ray West (former Black Panther, photojournalist) and Donda West (English professor). Father's absence after divorce shaped Ye's drive; mother's influence fostered intellectual rigor. Moved to Chicago at 3, grew up middle-class in a creative household—art, music, activism.

School: Polaris High School, where he discovered hip-hop production. College: Art Institute of Chicago, studying English, but dropped out to pursue music. Chip on shoulder from industry gatekeepers; self-taught producer, learning from soul samples and Chicago house. First big break: producing for Deric "D-Dot" Angelettie's group, then Jermaine Jackson. 1998: Moved to NYC, became in-house producer for Roc-A-Fella Records.

### Rise to Fame: The Producer Era (2000-2004)
Produced hits for Jay-Z ("H.A.M."), Alicia Keys, Ludacris. 2002: Signed to Roc-A-Fella as artist/producer. Debut album *The College Dropout* (2004) - soulful, introspective, gospel-infused. Themes: religion, materialism, self-consciousness. Singles: "Through the Wire" (post-crash recovery), "Slow Jamz" (with Twista & Jamie Foxx), "All Falls Down."

Artistic details: Soul samples (Aretha Franklin, Curtis Mayfield) reimagined with synths. Chi-town soul meets stadium rock ambitions. Fashion: Preppy, ironic—foreshadowing Yeezy era.

### Fame and Controversy: The VMA Incident (2005-2009)
*Late Registration* (2005): Orchestral collaboration with Jon Brion. Themes: Education, war, fame. Singles: "Diamonds from Sierra Leone," "Gold Digger." Grammy wins, but overshadowed by 2009 VMA interruption for Taylor Swift— "Beyoncé deserved it." Public backlash, but Ye's truth-telling authenticity shone.

*808s & Heartbreak* (2008): Auto-tune pioneer, R&B abstraction. Themes: Heartbreak, fame's toll. Influenced future rap.

### Peak and Fall: Watch the Throne Era (2010-2012)
*My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy* (2010): Post-VMA redemption. Maximalist, prog-rap. "Dark Fantasy" (Rick Ross sample). Themes: Arrogance, redemption.

Watch the Throne (2011) with Jay-Z: Luxury rap, Afrofuturism. "H.A.M.," "Why I Love You."

*Yeezus* (2015): Punk, abrasive. Themes: Anger, race.

### Gospel and Politics: Later Years (2016-Present)
*The Life of Pablo* (2016): Live-updated album, gospel/electronic. "Famous" feud with Taylor Swift.

*Jesus Is King* (2019): Full gospel. *Donda* (2021): Maximalist, personal.
