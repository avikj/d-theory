## Post-Submission Actions

### Immediate (Day 1)
- [ ] Save submission confirmation email
- [ ] Note manuscript ID number
- [ ] Add to calendar: check status in 2 weeks

### Week 2
- [ ] Check if editor assigned
- [ ] Respond to any immediate queries

### Months 1-6 (Review Period)
- [ ] Monitor email for reviewer comments
- [ ] Prepare to respond promptly (within 2-4 weeks of request)
- [ ] Have revised version ready if needed

### If Major Revisions Requested
- [ ] Address every reviewer comment systematically
- [ ] Prepare point-by-point response letter
- [ ] Highlight all changes in revised manuscript
- [ ] Resubmit within suggested timeline (usually 2-3 months)

### If Rejected
- [ ] Don't panic - rejection is common for novel work
- [ ] Read reviewer comments carefully
- [ ] Improve manuscript based on feedback
- [ ] Submit to next target journal (APAL)
- [ ] Mention previous submission and improvements made

## Success Metrics

### Acceptance Indicators
- Editor finds it "interesting and rigorous"
- Reviewers say "novel contribution" or "closes important gap"
- Minor revisions requested (not major)
- Positive comparison to prior work (Chaitin, Calude)

### Red Flags
- "Not sufficiently novel" (counter: witness extraction is new)
- "Too speculative" (emphasize proven results, mark conjectures clearly)
- "Not rigorous enough" (point to formal proofs, Curry-Howard)
- "Scope unclear" (clarify: PA unprovability, not absolute)

### How to Respond
- Be polite and grateful for feedback
- Address every point, even if you disagree
- Provide additional proofs/details if requested
- Revise tone if seen as overclaiming
- Add computational examples if requested

## Alternative Dissemination (if journal route delayed)

### Preprint
- [ ] Upload to arXiv.org (cs.LO or math.LO)
- [ ] Include note: "Submitted to JSL"
- [ ] Get arXiv ID for citations

### Conference Presentation
- [ ] LICS (Logic in Computer Science)
- [ ] LOFT (Logic and the Foundations of Game and Decision Theory)
- [ ] ASL Annual Meeting
- [ ] Computability in Europe

### Blog/Exposition
- [ ] Write accessible summary for broader audience
- [ ] Post on personal site or Medium
- [ ] Share on math/logic forums (with humility)

## Long-Term Goals

### If Accepted (Year 1)
- [ ] Celebrate! First major publication
- [ ] Update CV/website
- [ ] Prepare follow-up papers (see PUBLICATION_ROADMAP.md)
- [ ] Give talks at universities/conferences
- [ ] Build research network

### Citations Goal (Year 2-3)
- Target: 10-20 citations
- Likely citers: proof theory, complexity, foundations researchers
- Self-cite in follow-up work (Paper 1A: Distinction Functor)

### Impact Goal (Year 5)
- Establish "information-theoretic incompleteness" as recognized subfield
- Inspire other researchers to extend framework
- Possible textbook adoption (for advanced logic courses)
