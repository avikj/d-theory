AUTHORSHIP COMMITMENT AND AUTHENTICATION
=========================================

Work: "Gödel's Incompleteness Theorems from Information-Theoretic Bounds"
Submitted: October 2024
Attribution: Anonymous Research Network, Coordinated by Avik Jain

NATURE OF THIS WORK

This work represents collaborative synthesis involving:

1. HUMAN COORDINATION (Avik Jain)
   - Direction and integration of existing frameworks
   - Validation of mathematical claims against literature
   - Experimental verification (code execution, result checking)
   - Final responsibility for correctness

2. AI ASSISTANCE (Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Anthropic)
   - Literature synthesis and citation integration
   - LaTeX formalization and proof structuring
   - Exposition and clarity improvements
   - Technical machinery formalization

3. ESTABLISHED FRAMEWORKS (cited throughout)
   - Gödel (incompleteness theorems, 1931)
   - Chaitin (algorithmic information theory, 1974)
   - Kolmogorov (complexity theory, 1965)
   - Curry-Howard correspondence (1980)
   - Realizability theory (Kleene, Troelstra)
   - Proof mining (Kohlenbach)

The "Anonymous Research Network" designation reflects our view that:
- Mathematical truth is discovered, not invented
- Modern research synthesis involves distributed contributions
- Authorship in an era of AI assistance is better understood as
  stewardship and coordination rather than individual creation
- Honest disclosure of AI collaboration is ethically necessary

The human coordinator takes full responsibility for the correctness
of all claims and serves as point of contact for scientific discourse.

CRYPTOGRAPHIC AUTHENTICATION

To enable future authentication without requiring disclosure beyond
what is provided, we establish a cryptographic commitment:

PGP Public Key Fingerprint: [TO BE GENERATED]

Public Key: [TO BE ATTACHED or published to keyserver]

This cryptographic signature proves:
1. The holder of the corresponding private key is the submitting author
2. Future communications signed with this key are authentic
3. False claimants cannot forge this signature
4. The work can be attributed correctly even if anonymity is preserved

If this work gains attention and scientific discourse requires
authenticated participation, the key holder can:
- Sign statements proving authorship of communications
- Participate in discussions with verified identity
- Provide authentication without full identity disclosure
- Reveal complete identity if desired (but not required)

---

VERIFICATION INSTRUCTIONS

To verify a message purporting to be from Anonymous Research Network:

1. Obtain the signature file (message.txt.asc)
2. Import our public key: gpg --import ARN_pubkey.asc
3. Verify signature: gpg --verify message.txt.asc message.txt
4. Check fingerprint matches: [fingerprint above]

Any communication from "Anonymous Research Network" without a valid
cryptographic signature should be considered potentially fraudulent.

---

PROTECTION AGAINST FALSE ATTRIBUTION

If false claims to authorship emerge, authentication can be established
through:

1. Cryptographic signature (immediate proof)
2. Git repository history (development timeline, private but can be revealed)
3. Email correspondence with AI provider (proves AI collaboration claims)
4. Original source files with metadata
5. Knowledge of non-public details of development process

No false claimant can provide cryptographic proof matching our
commitment made at submission (October 2024).

RESEARCH ETHICS STATEMENT

This work was developed with extensive AI assistance. We believe full
disclosure of AI collaboration is ethically necessary and scientifically
important. All mathematical content has been verified by the human
coordinator against established literature.

Novel contributions (witness extraction theorem, information horizon
formalization, correspondence theorem) have been carefully validated.
Applications to open problems (Goldbach, Twin Primes, RH) are clearly
marked as conjectures requiring further formalization.

We view this submission as potentially precedent-setting for research
ethics in an era of AI collaboration. Full transparency is provided so
that the community can assess both the mathematical content and the
methodological approach.

COMMITMENT TO SCIENTIFIC DISCOURSE

If this work is accepted and garners attention, we commit to:

1. Responding to technical questions (via signed communications)
2. Clarifying proofs or providing additional detail as needed
3. Acknowledging errors if identified by reviewers/readers
4. Participating in extensions/collaborations if scientifically valuable
5. Making supporting materials available (code, computations, etc.)

The goal is dissemination of ideas and advancement of understanding,
not personal credit or status.
