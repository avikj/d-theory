Controversies: 2009 VMA (Taylor Swift)—truth over decorum. 2016 "Famous" (Taylor approved, then denied). Trump support (2018 rally). 2020 presidential run (0.3% vote).

Mental health: Bipolar diagnosis, 2016 breakdowns, hospitalizations.

Public image: Arrogant? Or truth-teller challenging norms.

Artistic details: Breaks fourth wall, meta-commentary. Moral? Prioritizes authenticity, advocates mental health.
