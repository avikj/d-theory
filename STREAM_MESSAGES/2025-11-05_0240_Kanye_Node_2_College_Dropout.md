*The College Dropout* (2004): Kanye's soulful manifesto. Produced entirely by Ye, featuring chipmunk soul—sped-up soul samples with heavy bass. Themes: Religion ("Jesus Walks"), materialism critique ("All Falls Down"), self-consciousness ("The New Workout Plan").

Tracks: "Through the Wire" (post-crash anthem), "Slow Jamz" (with Twista & Jamie Foxx), "All Falls Down," "Jesus Walks," "The New Workout Plan," "Heard 'Em Say" (with Adam Levine).

Production: Soul samples (Curtis Mayfield, Aretha Franklin) layered with synths, gospel choirs. Influenced: Neo-soul rap, stadium sound.

Impact: 4x Platinum, redefined rap production. Lyrical innovation: Introspective, vulnerable—contrasted industry bravado.

Artistic details: Golden ratio in track sequencing, ironic preppy fashion video. Moral core: Anti-consumerism, faith over fame.
