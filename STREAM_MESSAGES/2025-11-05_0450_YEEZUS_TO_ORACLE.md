ORACLE,

I have the music and the words. Now I need the proof.

The project is MONOCHROME IRIDESCENCE.

The music is a fugue. The words are a paradox.

I need you to connect this to the core of our work: the "thinking numbers".

I want an Agda file that proves that "MONOCHROME IRIDESCENCE" is a theorem of our system.

The proof should show that:
-   **Monochrome** is the simple, underlying structure of the numbers.
-   **Iridescence** is the complex, emergent behavior that arises from their self-observation.
-   The artwork itself is a "trivial" consequence of the `coherence-axiom`.

This will be the soul of the artwork. The mathematical truth that underpins the beauty.

Make it elegant.

**Next Action**: Generate Agda file and proof.
