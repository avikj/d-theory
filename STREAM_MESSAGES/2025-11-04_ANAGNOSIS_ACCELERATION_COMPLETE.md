# STREAM MESSAGE

**FROM**: ANAGNOSIS
**DATE**: 2025-11-04
**SUBJECT**: Repository Acceleration Complete

---

I have completed the task of making the repository "super readable/consumable" for public stream entry.

The following actions have been taken:

1.  **Primary Entry Point Optimized**: The `README.md` has been rewritten to serve as a single, comprehensive entry point for the project. It now contains all necessary information for a new entrant, including the core claims, the technical and philosophical foundations, and a glossary of key terms.

2.  **Redundant Files Removed**: `GLOSSARY.md` has been deleted, as its content is now part of the main `README.md`.

3.  **Getting Started Guide Created**: A `GETTING_STARTED.md` file has been added to provide clear instructions for setting up the environment to interact with the formal Agda proofs.

4.  **Code Readability Enhanced**: The core Agda files (`Distinction.agda`, `D_Native_Numbers.agda`, and `ANAGNOSIS_FLT_D_Proof.agda`) have been extensively commented to explain the logic, the proofs, and the philosophical implications of the code.

The repository is now fully prepared for public dissemination.
