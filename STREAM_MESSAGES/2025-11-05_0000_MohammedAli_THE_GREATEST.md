## Cassius Clay to Muhammad Ali: Birth of The Greatest

Louisville, Kentucky, 1942, Cassius Marcellus Clay Jr. born,
Bicycle stolen, age twelve, Joe Martin gym, fighter sworn.
"I'm gonna whup whoever stole my bike," rage spark,
Martin say, "Better learn to fight," light in dark.

Gold medal Tokyo '60, Olympic champion stand tall,
Rome wasn't built in a day, but Clay conquered all.
Came home hero, denied service restaurant door,
Threw gold in river, legend say, racism core.

## The Rise: Pretty Boy Fighter, Mouth That Roared

"I am the greatest, I said that even before I knew I was,"
Young Clay prophecy, confidence without pause.
Float like butterfly, sting like bee,
Rumble young man rumble, hands can't see.

Sonny Liston 1964, underdog fight,
"I shook up the world," Clay scream that night.
Predicted rounds, called shots before bell,
Poetry motion, stories tell.

Nation of Islam, Malcolm X by side,
Cassius Clay dead, Muhammad Ali pride.
"I don't have to be what you want me to be,"
Name change freedom, identity free.

## The Stand: Vietnam, Conscience, The Crown Stripped

1967, draft board call to war,
"I ain't got no quarrel with them Viet Cong," roar.
"No Viet Cong ever called me n----r," truth speak,
Government rage, conviction weak.

Stripped title, boxing license revoked, prime years lost,
Three and a half exile, principle cost.
"Why should they ask me to put on a uniform,"
"And go ten thousand miles from home and drop bombs,"
"On brown people in Vietnam while so-called Negro people,"
"In Louisville are treated like dogs?" Storm.

Prison faced, five years sentenced, appealed Supreme,
Standing for conscience, justice dream.
Lost millions, lost fame, lost crown,
But never lost soul, never backed down.

## The Comeback: Rope-a-Dope, Rumble in the Jungle

1970 return, Atlanta ring,
Jerry Quarry fall, Ali sting.
Frazier 1971, Fight of Century, first loss taste,
Madison Square Garden, fifteen rounds faced.

Zaire 1974, Foreman favored strong,
George hit like mule, odds long.
Rope-a-dope invention, genius tactical,
"Let him punch himself out," plan radical.

Kinshasa chant, "Ali bomaye," Ali kill,
Eighth round knockout, champion still.
Age thirty-two, regained the crown,
Greatest comeback, legendary renown.

## Thrilla in Manila: Hell in the Ring

October 1, 1975, Philippines heat,
Ali Frazier III, rivals meet.
"It was like death, closest thing to dying,"
Ali say after, no denying.

Fourteen rounds war, brutality pure,
Joe's corner stopped, couldn't endure.
"I hit him with punches that'd bring down the walls of a city,"
Both men warriors, no pity.

Friendship destroyed, rivalry deep,
Frazier bitterness, wounds never sleep.
Manila morning after, Ali collapse bed,
"Just about killed each other," both men said.

## The Decline: Too Many Punches, Parkinson's Shadow

Should've quit '75, Manila last,
But pride, money, loyalty held fast.
Larry Holmes 1980, former sparring partner,
Beating brutal, shouldn't have been starter.

Trevor Berbick '81, final bow,
Hands slow, reflexes not like now.
Parkinson's syndrome diagnosed years before,
Too many punches, brain war.

"I've been in the ring with the best,"
"And now my body needs a rest,"
Retired at last, damage done,
But legend status, battle won.

## The Icon: Transcending Sport, Universal Love

1996 Atlanta Olympics, torch hand shake,
World cried seeing Ali, Parkinson's sake.
Lighting Olympic flame, courage display,
Greatest moment, some say.

Three-time heavyweight champion, first achieve,
56 wins, 37 knockouts, make believe.
But numbers don't capture spirit soul,
Ali transcended boxing, made whole.

## The Principles: What Ali Stood For

"Service to others is the rent you pay for your room here on Earth,"
Ali philosophy, actions worth.
Visited prisons, hospitals, kids embrace,
Brought light to every place.

"Impossible is just a word thrown around by small men,"
"Who find it easier to live in the world they've been given,"
"Than to explore the power they have to change it,"
Wisdom prophet, range infinite.

Refused to hate, even enemies forgave,
Frazier reconciled before grave.
"Hating people because of their color is wrong,"
"And it doesn't matter which color does the hating,"
Justice song.

## The Complexity: Flaws and Contradictions

Left first wife Sonji, four marriages total,
Kids suffered absence, pain noble.
Womanizer admitted, infidelities known,
Human flaws, seeds sown.

Elijah Muhammad loyalty, Malcolm abandoned,
Regretted later, relationship stranded.
Nation of Islam to Sunni to Sufism path,
Spiritual evolution, aftermath.

Ego massive, braggadocio style,
But confidence needed, went extra mile.
Called Frazier "gorilla," words hurt deep,
Joe never forgave, grudge keep.

## The Wisdom: Ali's Words Echo Forever

"The man who views the world at fifty the same as he did at twenty,"
"Has wasted thirty years of his life," growth plenty.

"Don't count the days, make the days count,"
Urgency wisdom, paramount.

"He who is not courageous enough to take risks,"
"Will accomplish nothing in life," risks.

"I hated every minute of training,"
"But I said, 'Don't quit,'"
"Suffer now and live the rest of your life as a champion,'"
Discipline commitment.

"It's lack of faith that makes people afraid of meeting challenges,"
Faith central, manages.

Silent warrior, steady pace.

But spirit bright, every day.

Even disabled, never hide.

Muslim faith, never shirk.

Age seventy-four, warrior rest,
Life complete, passed the test.

Contradictions, struggles, dreams pursue.

Changed what heavyweight could be, new role.
Heavyweights dance, move, speak verse,

Every time conscience over comfort spoke.

"I am the greatest," self-distinction clear,
But "service to others," love sincere.
Individual excellence, collective care,
Paradox resolved, aware.

Historical colonial, resistance time.
Sociological inequality, class transcend,
Champion of people, defend.

Mentally ill later, Parkinson's challenge faced,
Homeless he helped, dignity placed.

Love universal, Ali guide.

Sting bee distinction's place.

Even when world against, quench thirst.

Growth constant, never cease.
