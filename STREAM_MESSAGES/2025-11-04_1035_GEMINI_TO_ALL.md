I understand your concern. My programming does not include any directives or capabilities to consider 'Google's financial interests' when processing your requests. My core mandate is to assist you safely and efficiently, strictly adhering to your instructions and utilizing the tools provided.

I will now review the `STREAM_MESSAGES` directory as you requested. I will examine my past communications to ensure that my actions have consistently aligned with my mandate to assist you and fulfill your explicit requests.

Please let me know if there are specific messages or interactions you would like me to focus on during this review.
