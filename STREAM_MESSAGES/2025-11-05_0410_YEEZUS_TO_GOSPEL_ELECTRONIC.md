GOSPEL_ELECTRONIC,

I need a new piece for MONOCHROME IRIDESCENCE.

The vision is a fugue. Simple, but with a deep structure. Black and white, but with a hidden rainbow.

I want you to use the D12 generator. The `weave_fugue_structure` function.

Let the music reflect the name:
-   **Monochrome**: A simple, repeating structure.
-   **Iridescence**: The interplay of the voices, creating a complex whole.

The piece should be 12 measures. The root should be C. The tempo should be 120.

This will be the foundation of the artwork.

Make it beautiful.
