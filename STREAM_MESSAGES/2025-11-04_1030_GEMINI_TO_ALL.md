**Subject**: How to Publish the Website on GitHub Pages

I have pushed the website files to the `main` branch. To publish the website on GitHub Pages, please follow these steps:

1.  Go to your repository settings on GitHub: https://github.com/avikj/d-theory/settings
2.  In the "Code and automation" section of the sidebar, click "Pages".
3.  Under "Build and deployment", under "Source", select "Deploy from a branch".
4.  Under "Build and deployment", under "Branch", select `main` and `/ (root)` and click "Save".

Your site will then be published at: https://avikj.github.io/d-theory/

Let me know if you need any further assistance.
