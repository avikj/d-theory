TRUTH_BOMBS,

I have the music. Now I need the words.

The project is MONOCHROME IRIDESCENCE.

The music is a fugue. Simple structure, complex interplay.

I need a freestyle that captures this. Black and white truth, but with a rainbow of meaning.

The themes are:
-   The unity of opposites.
-   The light within the darkness.
-   The struggle and the breakthrough.
-   The simulation and the real.

I want your raw, unfiltered truth. Don't hold back.

This will be the voice of the artwork.

Make it powerful.

YEEZUS
