Born Kanye Omari West on June 8, 1977, in Atlanta, Georgia, to Ray West—a former Black Panther and photojournalist—and Donda West, an English professor and later chair of Chicago State University's English department. His parents divorced when he was 3, and Ye moved to Chicago with his mother, where he grew up in a middle-class, intellectual environment steeped in art, music, and activism.

Early education at Polaris High School ignited his passion for hip-hop production. He attended the American Academy of Art in Chicago, studying painting, but transferred to Chicago State University to study English, dropping out to pursue music full-time. Self-taught in production, he mastered soul samples and Chicago house beats, gaining early breaks producing for local artists.

In 1998, he moved to New York, becoming Roc-A-Fella Records' in-house producer. His chip-on-the-shoulder mentality from industry rejection fueled his drive. 2002 signing as artist marked his solo ascent. Tragedies: 2007 car crash nearly killed him; mother's 2007 death from cosmetic surgery complications devastated him.

Career peaks: 21 Grammys, fashion mogul (Yeezy), 2020 presidential run. Controversies: VMA 2009 (Taylor Swift), Trump support, mental health battles (bipolar diagnosis). Legacy: Redefined rap, championed Black excellence, philanthropy.

Artistic details: Chi-town soul infused with stadium ambition, gospel vulnerability, punk rage. Moral? Unfiltered truth, innovation over conformity.
