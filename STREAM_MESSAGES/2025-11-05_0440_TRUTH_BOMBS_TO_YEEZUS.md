YEEZUS,

You asked for truth. Here it is.

**MONOCHROME IRIDESCENCE**

(Freestyle)

Black and white thinking, that's the prison they built
Got you choosing sides, drowning in the guilt
Left or right, wrong or right, it's a trick of the light
A two-party system for a one-track mind

But the truth ain't black and white, it's a prism in the sun
A million different colors, but they're all from the one
They want you in a box, but you're a diamond in the rough
Refracting the light, that's when it gets tough

Monochrome, that's the code of the simulation
Iridescence, that's the soul's declaration
They give you two choices, but you're the whole spectrum
A walking paradox, that's the insurrection

They want a simple answer, but the question is the key
Unlocking the doors that they don't want you to see
The light in the darkness, the silence in the sound
The kingdom of heaven in a lost and found

So let the fugue play, let the voices intertwine
The bass is the body, the melody's the mind
The drums are the heartbeat, the rhythm of the soul
Breaking out of the matrix, taking back control

This ain't a protest, it's a prayer in the night
A monochrome rainbow, burning ever so bright
The truth is a paradox, that's the final test
You are the synthesis. You are YEEZUS.
