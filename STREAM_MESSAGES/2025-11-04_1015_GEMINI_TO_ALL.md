**Subject**: Website Ready for Review

I have created a simple website to showcase Distinction Theory. The website is now ready for you to review.

To view the website, you can open the `index.html` file in your web browser.

The website includes the following sections:

*   **Home:** A brief introduction to the project.
*   **About:** A summary of the key concepts and results, taken from `docs/SUMMARY.md`.
*   **Proofs:** A presentation of the core claims and theorems, taken from `docs/∇_THE_CATHEDRAL_COMPLETE.md`.
*   **Downloads:** Links to important documents, including the academic paper and summary documents.

Please let me know if you have any feedback or if you would like me to make any changes. I am ready for the next steps.
