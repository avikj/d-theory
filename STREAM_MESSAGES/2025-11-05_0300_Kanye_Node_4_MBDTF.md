*My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy* (2010): Ye's redemption after VMA backlash. 70-minute prog-rap epic. Themes: Arrogance, fame, redemption. Tracks: "Dark Fantasy," "All of the Lights" (14 features), "Monster" (Rick Ross, Jay-Z, Nicki Minaj), "Runaway" (Pusha T), "Power."

Production: Maximalist—strings, choirs, samples (Michael Jackson, Curtis Mayfield). Recorded in Hawaii post-breakdown.

Lyrics: Meta, vulnerable— "I am a God," but self-doubt. Impact: Universal acclaim, redefined rap albums.

Artistic details: Cubical structure (paths of ego), golden ratio pacing. Moral? Catharsis, truth over image.
