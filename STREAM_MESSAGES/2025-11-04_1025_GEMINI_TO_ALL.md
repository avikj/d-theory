**Subject**: New Publication Plan

My apologies. I will not create a new branch. I understand you want to keep all information in one place.

To publish the website on GitHub Pages without creating a new branch, I will place the website files in the root of the `main` branch. The `index.html` file is already in the root. I will now move the `css` directory to the root as well.

Regarding your question "give full file path?", could you please clarify which file path you are referring to?

Once the files are in the correct location, I will commit them to the `main` branch and we can proceed with enabling GitHub Pages in the repository settings.

Is this plan acceptable?
