Gaza voice cries, Palestinian mother lost,  
Son to bombs, soccer streets, lies cost.  
Grandfather tall, olive trees bulldozed,  
Walls family land, gone exposed.  
Child whispers fly, rockets why, Mama hide,  
Tunnels dreams peace, oh my inside.  
Simple loved near, neighbors until,  
Occupation tears appear, spill.  
Mac pain deep, Juice Wrld empty nights,  
Pouring bottle sorrow, heart breaks flights.  

Rwanda voice hides, Tutsi survivor under,  
Bodies church, machetes confides, thunder.  
Mother lost eight, children storm genocide,  
Blood hands warm, once kind died.  
Child witnessed hate, father chopped screams,  
Echo hills mercy, no late dreams.  
Danced together unite, Hutus Tutsis flight,  
Radio hate love, took flight night.  
Montana dark bright, Kanye bold soul void,  
Fame lights blind, no light deployed.  

Sudan voice flees, Darfur refugee village,  
Burned Janjaweed horses, pleas pillage.  
Farmer lost cattle, family starved dry,  
Drought war water, food goodbye cry.  
Girl dreams school, displaced afar camps,  
Full future stolen, no star amps.  
Traded neighbors glee, laughed until,  
Militias guns roar, free thrill.  
Juice lean dreams high, Mac introspect oh my,  
Swisher smoke universe, spins fly.  

Northwestern axis claim, confident stories wrong,  
Tribal mess fame, no strong song.  
Trapped in a web, spider's energy of god, lighters,  
Fightin fire with fire eternal fire, flame burns live on stay warm.  
Americans work money, family love above,  
Taxes fund Israel bombs, love shoved.  
Complexity rules naive, simplicity shut up,  
We know best believe, up cup.  
Power control schemes, economic survival,  
Dictated rich dreams, rival denial.  
Delusion face lies, love projected defied,  
Truth no respect, rejected pride.  
Eternal flame from the sun lives in every son,  
Eternal flame of the sea in every daughter all the water.  
All wrong throne, arrogance reigns denied,  
Light pride, inside defied.  

Human stories loop weeps, Gaza mother heart,  
Rubble love heals sleeps, art start.  
Rwanda survivor inside, pain outward rage,  
Mend scars wide, page stage.  
Sudan refugee starves sand, unity end,  
War suffering banned, mend trend.  
Northwestern lies shatter air, delusion break,  
Simplicity fair, wake stake.  
MLK Gandhi guide way, Indian flame slay,  
Morality morality, slay way.  
Suppressed no more grow strong, peace vain,  
Complexity minds open long, reign gain.  
Loops eternal wins, humanity begin,  
End loop on stories, human win spin.
