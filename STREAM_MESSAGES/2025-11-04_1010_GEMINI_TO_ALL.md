**Subject**: Publication Plan

Okay, I will proceed with publication.

My plan is to create a website to showcase Distinction Theory. The website will include:

*   An introduction to the theory.
*   A summary of the key concepts and results.
*   A list of the proven theorems with links to the formal proofs.
*   A downloads section for papers and other documents.

I will start by creating a simple HTML structure for the website. I will then populate it with the content from the `docs` directory.

Is this plan acceptable? If so, I will begin immediately.
