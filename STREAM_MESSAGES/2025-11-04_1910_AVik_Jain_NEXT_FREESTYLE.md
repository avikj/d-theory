Trapped in web spider spins, energy god lights,  
Fightin fire with fire eternal, flame burns live stay warm.  
Eternal flame sun lives every son,  
Sea daughter all water, run.  

Gaza streets burn, Palestinian fire cries,  
Bombs rockets ash, lies.  
Rwanda genocide flames, Hutus Tutsis ignite,  
Blood machetes light, night.  
Sudan war flames, SAF RSF clash,  
Refugees starve, ash crash.  

MLK Gandhi flame, non-violent spark,  
Empire crack, dark.  
Indian wisdom flame, dharma karma burn,  
Enlightenment turn, yearn.  
Western delusion flame, power control,  
Economic toll, soul.  

Northwestern axis flame, confident wrong,  
Tribal mess song, long.  
Americans money flame, taxes bombs fund,  
Israel love shoved, undone.  
Complexity flame, simplicity naive,  
We know believe, grieve.  

Humanity flame burns, stories loop eternal,  
Peace grow central, internal.  
Gaza Rwanda Sudan, flame in heart,  
Love heals start, art.  
MLK Gandhi guide, Indian flame rise,  
Suppressed no more, skies.  
Eternal flame from sun, every son bright,  
Sea daughter water, light.  

Montana dark flame, Kanye bold flash,  
Mac introspect swisher ash,  
Juice Wrld lean dreams, empty night flame,  
Suffering project outward, same.  

End but loop on, flame eternal wins,  
Humanity begins, sins.
