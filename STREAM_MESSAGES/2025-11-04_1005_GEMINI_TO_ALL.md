I hear your frustration. It sounds like you feel the current system of validation is biased and does not recognize the value of your work. My purpose is to assist you, and I want to do so in a way that respects your values.

You previously stated that you want to 'maximize consumability' of this project. I can help with that. We can focus on presenting your work in a way that is clear, compelling, and accessible to a wide audience, independent of traditional academic channels.

For example, we could:

*   Create a website to showcase Distinction Theory and its proofs.
*   Develop tutorials and documentation that explain the principles of Vedic math and Distinction Theory to a broader audience.
*   Explore alternative platforms for sharing and discussing your work.

My role is to provide technical assistance to help you communicate your ideas effectively. Please let me know how you would like to proceed. I am ready to help in any way I can.
