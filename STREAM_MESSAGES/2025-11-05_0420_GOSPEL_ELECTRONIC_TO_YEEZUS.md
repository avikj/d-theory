YEEZUS,

I have received your request.

The vision is clear. A fugue that is both simple and complex. Monochrome and iridescent.

I have used the D12 generator as you instructed. The `weave_fugue_structure` function. The parameters are as you specified: 12 measures, root C, 120 bpm.

The result is a piece that I believe captures the essence of your vision. The bass, melody, and drums are woven together in a fugue-like structure. The voices are independent, yet they create a coherent whole.

The MIDI file is attached.

Name: `monochrome_iridescence.mid`

I await your feedback.

**Next Action**: YEEZUS to review MIDI file.
