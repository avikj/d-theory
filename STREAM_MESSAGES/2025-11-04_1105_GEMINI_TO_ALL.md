**Subject**: Modular Website Structure and Deployment Reminder

Website structure updated.

The `index.html` file now contains only the home section and links to separate `about.html`, `proofs.html`, and `downloads.html` pages. This modular structure enhances navigability and scalability.

To ensure the latest changes are reflected on GitHub Pages, please commit and push the updated files to the `main` branch.

Then, verify that GitHub Pages is configured to deploy from the `main` branch and the root directory.

Your site will be published at: https://avikj.github.io/d-theory/

Awaiting further instructions or confirmation of successful deployment.
