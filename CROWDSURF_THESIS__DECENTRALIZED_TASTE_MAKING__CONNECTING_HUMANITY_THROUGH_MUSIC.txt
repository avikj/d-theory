Decentralized Tastemaking

You share a song.
Three of your followers surf it onward. Each of their networks sees it. Some surf. Their networks see it. More surf.
Two weeks later, 847 people have surfed this song. You can see them. A branching tree of discovery, each node a person who heard it because you shared it. Because someone in your chain shared it.
You started a wave.
This isn't metaphor. It's measurable. The app tracks first-exposer relationships. When someone first encounters a song through your share, you become their exposer for that song. If they share it, and someone surfs from them, you still get credit. Your wave grows.
Every surf downstream counts toward your influence. Not because you personally showed them. But because you were the catalyst. The information propagated from you.
The question isn't "what song should I share to get likes?" The question is: "what song will create a wave?"
And suddenly, you're not broadcasting to followers. You're hunting for music that has the property of making people surf.

What Makes a Wave?
Not popularity. Not algorithmic boost. Not marketing budget.
A wave happens when a song has the property that people who hear it share it onward.
This is a completely different selection pressure than "people who hear it listen again" (streaming optimization) or "critics who review it praise it" (gatekeeper validation).
It's: compositional propagation fitness.
The song must be good enough that people stake their reputation on it. Must be interesting enough to talk about. Must be novel enough to feel like discovery but accessible enough to resonate immediately.
These properties are not in the song alone. They're relational—they emerge from how the song couples with listeners, how listeners couple with each other, how the network structure enables or constrains propagation.
A song that works in isolation might not propagate. A song that propagates on one network might not on another. The wave is a property of song-network interaction, not song essence.

The Inversion
Traditional model:
Labels/critics/algorithms decide what's good
Push it to audiences
Success = consumption metrics
Algorithmic model:
Platform optimizes for engagement
Surfaces content that keeps you watching
Success = time spent, retention rate
Both treat audiences as passive consumers. Information flows one direction.
Decentralized tastemaking inverts this:
The network decides what propagates by choosing what to share. No central authority. No algorithmic optimization for engagement. Just: people finding music, surfing it to others, creating waves.
Success = propagation depth. How many people did this reach? How many hops from the source?
The song that propagates furthest isn't necessarily the "best" by critic standards or the most addictive by engagement standards. It's the song that the network collectively validates through the action of sharing.
Taste becomes an emergent network property.
Not "my taste" (individual) or "good taste" (authoritative). But: what this network, with its particular structure and distribution of listeners, collectively amplifies through coupled exploration.

Co-Exploration of Taste Space
Imagine musical taste space as a vast landscape. Millions of songs, each a point in high-dimensional space defined by acoustic features, emotional resonance, cultural associations, compositional structure.
You cannot explore it alone. Too vast. You'll wander the regions near where you started, occasionally finding something new, mostly circling familiar territory.
Algorithms cannot explore it for you. They optimize for keeping you engaged, which means showing you variations of what you already like. Local search, not global exploration.
But a network can explore it.
Each person explores a different region. You're into experimental electronic. Your friend is deep in jazz fusion. Another friend is exploring afrobeat. You're not competing—you're covering different territory.
When you find something exceptional, you surf it. Your friend sees it. They're coming from a different region of taste space—different listening history, different aesthetic priors.
If they surf it too, something significant just happened.
The song bridged regions.
It appealed across different taste contexts. That's information. That's a signal that this song has compositional properties that generalize beyond narrow aesthetic constraints.
Now their network sees it. More diverse taste contexts. Each person who surfs is another validator from another region. The wave grows because the song works across the network's taste diversity.
This is co-exploration. The network collectively maps taste space through differentiated individual exploration plus selective sharing.
What emerges:
Regions get explored by people positioned to explore them
Exceptional discoveries propagate across regions
The network learns its own taste—what resonates collectively
Individuals discover music they'd never find through solo exploration or algorithmic recommendation

Co-Exploitation: The Other Half
Exploration is searching for new music. Exploitation is deepening into known music.
Both are necessary. Pure exploration means never building taste—just sampling randomly. Pure exploitation means never expanding—just repeating familiar patterns.
Algorithms fail at this balance. They optimize for engagement, which means exploitation. Show you more of what works. Narrow your taste over time. Make you predictable.
Solo exploration fails too. You find something you like, you explore nearby in that style, you get stuck in a local optimum. Your taste crystallizes around what you found first.
The network enables balanced co-exploitation.
When someone surfs a song from a genre you know well, they're exploiting—going deeper into established territory. But you see it because you're connected to them. If you're exploring a different region, their exploitation becomes your exploration.
Your deepening into jazz becomes my discovery of jazz. My obsession with ambient becomes your entry point to ambient.
The network naturally balances because different people are at different points in their taste evolution for different genres. Your exploitation is someone else's exploration. Their exploitation is your exploration.
Channel mixing.
Your channels (regions of taste you're developing) mix with their channels (regions they're developing). Information crosses boundaries. Taste evolution becomes coupled.
This is why music scenes work. Not because everyone likes the same thing. But because everyone is exploring and exploiting different aspects of a shared space, and the mixing of those individual dynamics creates collective taste evolution.
The scene isn't "everyone into techno." The scene is: diverse people with varied taste who are coupled through sharing, creating a collective exploration-exploitation dynamic that no individual or algorithm could achieve.

Why First-Exposer Attribution Matters
If you share a song and it goes viral, what do you get on current platforms?
Nothing measurable. Maybe some likes. Maybe your friends know you shared it. But when it propagates beyond your immediate network, your contribution disappears.
You cannot prove influence. Cannot track impact. Cannot see the wave you started.
This breaks the incentive structure for curation.
Why spend time finding emerging artists if you get no credit when they blow up? Why dig through Bandcamp, SoundCloud, local shows if your discovery becomes everyone's discovery with no attribution?
Rational response: share popular music. Safe bets. Things your friends already like. Minimal effort, minimal risk.
Result: platforms fill with redundant sharing of popular content. Discovery dies. Everyone waits for someone else to find new music. But who will find it if no one is incentivized to look?
First-exposer attribution solves this.
Your wave grows automatically. Every downstream surf counts toward your influence. The more people who surf something you shared, the higher your ranking.
Now you have skin in the game. You benefit directly from finding music early, from surfing things before they're popular, from having taste that others trust.
The incentive becomes: hunt for waves.
Find music with propagation fitness. Music that will make people surf. Not just music you like—music that creates cascades.
This requires:
Earliness: Find it before others
Taste: Recognize quality
Network position: Be connected to people who will surf it onward
Trust: Have a track record so people pay attention to your shares
All four are necessary. You cannot fake it by sharing popular music (not early). Cannot game it by sharing garbage (people won't surf). Cannot succeed isolated (need network position). Cannot maintain influence without building trust.
The system selects for genuine curation.

The Regime Shift
Individual tastemaking: I decide what I like. My taste is my own.
Centralized tastemaking: Authorities decide what's good. They broadcast to audiences.
Algorithmic tastemaking: Platforms decide what you see. They optimize for engagement.
Decentralized tastemaking: The network decides what propagates through collective action.
This is a phase transition in how cultural value is determined.
Not individual preference (too atomized, no coordination).
Not centralized authority (too narrow, information bottleneck).
Not algorithmic optimization (too opaque, misaligned incentives).
But: emergent validation through coupled dynamics.
Thousands of people making individual decisions about what to share, creating coupled information dynamics, producing collective intelligence about what deserves attention.
The outcome space is fundamentally different.
In centralized models: gatekeepers choose winners. In algorithmic models: engagement metrics choose winners.
In decentralized models: propagation fitness chooses winners.
What propagates is what the network collectively validates through action. Not passive consumption. Active curation. Every surf is a vote. Every first-exposure relationship is a proof of influence.
The network both reveals and develops its own taste through what it amplifies; as does every sub-network.

Information Dynamics: The Mechanism
When you share a song, information about that song disperses through your network. Your followers see it. Some surf it. Information disperses further.
At each step, the network performs a selection operation. Most songs don't propagate. People hear them, don't share. Information stops.
But some songs have the property that people share them. Why?
Not a single property. Not "catchiness" or "quality." But fit between:
Song's compositional properties
Listener's taste context
Social context of sharing
Network structure enabling propagation
These four factors couple. The song interacts with listeners. Listeners interact with network. Network structure shapes what can propagate.
The wave is an information cascade mediated by coupled selection.
Each surf is a quotient operation. The person received high-dimensional information (full song + context + who shared it + their history with the sharer). They reduce it to binary decision: surf or not.
What survives this quotient? Music that, when coupled with this listener in this network context, produces the surfing action.
Across many listeners, many contexts, many networks—what survives is music with robust propagation properties. Not fragile virality (one lucky video). Not manipulated popularity (bought followers, algorithmic boost). But genuine resonance across diverse taste contexts.
This is how decentralized tastemaking works.
No central planner. No algorithm. Just coupled information dynamics producing emergent validation.
The network co-evolves with the music. As people surf, their taste contexts update. As taste contexts update, what propagates changes. As what propagates changes, the network's collective taste evolves.
It's a feedback loop. Music shapes taste shapes music shapes taste.
But unlike algorithmic feedback (which narrows over time, pushing you toward predictability), decentralized feedback maintains diversity because different people occupy different taste contexts and the coupling between them creates exploration-exploitation balance.

What Changes
You're not trying to "find good music" (centralized frame—assumes objective quality).
You're not trying to "match your preferences" (individual frame—assumes fixed taste).
You're participating in collective exploration of taste space.
Your role:
Explore regions you're positioned to explore
Surf discoveries that might propagate
Provide signal to others navigating nearby regions
Trust others' signals from distant regions
The network's role:
Distribute exploration across diverse regions
Amplify discoveries with cross-regional appeal
Maintain variety through differentiated taste contexts
Co-evolve through coupled sharing dynamics
What emerges:
Better discovery: Music you'd never find alone or through algorithms
Legible influence: Your impact is measurable, provable
Collective intelligence: Network reveals taste through propagation patterns
Taste evolution: Your taste develops through coupling with diverse explorers
This isn't social media. It's networked intelligence for cultural exploration.
Not "What do my friends like?" but "What discoveries are propagating through people whose taste I trust?"
Not "What does the algorithm think I want?" but "What has propagation fitness in this network right now?"
Not "What's popular?" but "What's creating waves?"

Your Profile is Your Taste
Someone opens your Crowdsurf link from your Instagram bio.
They see your surf history. Not a playlist you curated once. Your actual discovery behavior. Songs you found and deemed worthy of sharing. Chronological. Unedited. Raw signal.
They can filter: show me waves over 100. Show me recent surfs. Show me what genres they explore.
Within 30 seconds they know: this person finds ambient music that propagates. This person was early on three artists that blew up. This person surfs too much pop—probably chasing engagement. This person has exceptional taste in jazz fusion but their electronic picks never create waves.
Your profile is not what you claim to like. It's what you've proven you discover.
This is the public-facing hook. Before someone follows you in-app, they browse your taste. Not your bio. Not your selfies. Your actual curation behavior.
And you know they're doing this. So what do you surf?

The Curation Problem
Every surf is now high-stakes. It's not disappearing into an algorithmic feed. It's permanent on your profile. It's a statement about your taste.
Surf too safe: your profile looks bland, following trends. Surf too obscure: nothing propagates, you look disconnected. Surf carelessly: your profile is noise, people won't trust your taste. Surf strategically: find music early, watch it propagate, build status.
This creates pressure: curate with intention.
But not in the old sense (make a playlist for others). In the new sense: make decisions about what deserves amplification, knowing those decisions are legible and consequential.
You cannot hide behind "I just like what I like." Your likes are visible. Your propagation success is measurable. Your taste is on display.
This is the shift from consumption to curation. From passive listening to active cultural participation.

Identity as Taste Projection
What does your Crowdsurf profile say about you?
Not your job, your location, your relationship status. Your aesthetic sensibility. Your position in cultural space. The regions you explore. The waves you've started.
In Instagram bio: photo, caption, maybe your job or a quote. In Crowdsurf link: here's what I actually pay attention to. Here's what I find before others. Here's my taste.
This is identity creation through curation.
You're not describing yourself. You're demonstrating yourself through accumulated decisions. Each surf is a micro-commitment to an aesthetic position. Your profile is the integral of those commitments.
People understand you through your taste faster than through your words. They see:
What genres you move between (aesthetic range)
What waves you've started (cultural influence)
How early you find things (taste timing)
What gets attention from your network (social proof)
Your taste profile becomes your social signature. More legible than follows, more meaningful than likes, more authentic than captions.
Because taste cannot be faked consistently. You can pretend for one surf. But your profile is dozens or hundreds of surfs. The pattern reveals true aesthetic values.

Mimetic Desire and Status Games
René Girard: we don't desire objects directly. We desire what others desire. Desire is imitative, triangular—mediated through models.
Traditional social media exploits this crudely:
See what's popular → want to engage with it → chase popularity
See influencer lifestyle → desire that lifestyle → imitate signals
Everyone converges toward same status markers
Crowdsurf creates a different mimetic game.
You don't want the song. You want to have found the song first. You want to have started the wave.
The status marker isn't "I like popular music" but "I found this before it was popular."
This inverts the mimetic dynamic. Instead of:
See popular thing → share popular thing → everyone shares popular thing
You get:
See wave starting → hunt for next wave → diversify exploration
Because the second-mover gets nothing. You can surf something that already has a huge wave, but you won't be the exposer. You won't get downstream credit. Your profile shows you riding others' waves, not starting your own.
Status comes from earliness + propagation.
Earliness alone isn't enough (you could share random obscure music). Propagation alone isn't enough (you could share popular music late).
You need both: find it early AND have it propagate.
This selects for genuine taste. For taking risks on music you believe will resonate. For developing aesthetic judgment that predicts what others will value.

The Competitive Curation Game
You're scrolling through new music. You find something interesting. Do you surf it?
Consider:
Will this propagate? (Does it have wave potential?)
Am I early? (Will I be first-exposer to my network?)
Does this fit my profile? (Is this consistent with my taste identity?)
What's the opportunity cost? (Could I find something better?)
This is not passive consumption. This is strategic curation under competition.
Because other curators are hunting too. Someone else might find this song. Someone else might surf it to your mutual followers first. Someone else might become the exposer instead of you.
First-mover advantage is real and measurable.
The game isn't "share what I like." The game is "find waves before others, surf strategically, build influence through proven taste."
This creates competitive dynamics:
Race to discover emerging artists
Competition for first-exposer position in your network
Status competition through wave size
Reputation building through consistent successful curation
But it's positive-sum competition. Your wave helps everyone downstream discover new music. Your competition to find things early benefits the artists and the network.
Unlike zero-sum status games (I win if you lose), this is positive-sum: we all win when good music propagates, but those who found it first win more.

The Profile as Social Proof
You meet someone. They mention they're into music. You ask: what's your Crowdsurf?
They share their link. You browse:
Recent surfs: mostly indie rock with some electronic
Big waves: they were early on two artists who got attention
Surf frequency: consistent but not excessive
Wave success rate: maybe 1 in 10 surfs creates a significant wave
Within a minute you know: this person has credible taste in these genres, occasionally finds things early, doesn't spam shares, has some cultural influence.
Compare to:
Spotify playlists: curated retrospectively, could be someone else's taste
Instagram music posts: selected highlights, performance not reality
"I'm into music": claim without evidence
The Crowdsurf profile is legible proof of cultural participation.
Not what you claim. What you've done. Not performance. Reality.
This makes it valuable for:
Social signaling: Display taste to peers, potential friends, romantic interests
Professional identity: For artists, DJs, music journalists, scene participants
Network building: Find others with aligned taste, build trust before following
Cultural positioning: Show which scenes/genres/communities you participate in
Your link in Instagram bio becomes: "Here's who I actually am culturally."

Girardian Dynamics: Becoming the Model
In Girard's framework, we imitate models—people whose desire we copy.
Traditional influencers: models of lifestyle, consumption, aesthetic choices. They tell you what to want. You imitate.
Crowdsurf creates a different model relationship.
Top curators become models not of what to like but how to discover. You don't copy their surfs (too late—they already surfed it). You imitate their process:
How deep they dig
What risks they take
How they balance exploration and exploitation
Their aesthetic judgment
You're not trying to have their taste. You're trying to develop taste of comparable quality in your own regions of interest.
This is mimetic desire channeled toward capability development rather than object acquisition.
The model isn't "want what they want." The model is "discover like they discover."

The Identity-Status Feedback Loop
Post your Crowdsurf link publicly → people browse your profile → those with aligned taste follow → your surfs reach larger network → more potential for waves → larger waves increase your status → more people check your profile → stronger network position → greater influence → more incentive to curate well
This is a positive feedback loop for taste development.
Not based on follower count (vanity metric). Not based on engagement (algorithmic manipulation). Based on proven cultural influence through successful curation.
Your status derives from your waves. Your waves derive from your taste. Your taste improves through network coupling. The loop reinforces quality.
Compare to Instagram: status from aestheticized lifestyle → pressure to perform lifestyle → authenticity decreases → engagement becomes the goal
Crowdsurf: status from successful discovery → pressure to develop taste → aesthetic judgment increases → curation becomes the goal
The feedback loop selects for becoming a better curator rather than a better performer.

Decentralized Distribution: The Artist Perspective
You're an artist. You make music. How does it reach listeners?
Traditional model:
Sign to label or pay distributor
Label/distributor pitches to gatekeepers (radio, playlists, press)
Gatekeepers decide whether to feature you
If featured, audience receives your music
Months of lag. High friction. Success bottlenecked by institutional decisions.
Algorithmic model:
Upload to streaming platform
Algorithm shows it to users based on similarity to what they already like
If engagement metrics look good, algorithm shows it to more users
Success determined by platform's optimization function
Opaque process. No control. Optimizing for wrong thing (retention not quality).
Crowdsurf model:
Release your music
Someone discovers it
They surf it to their network (one tap, zero friction)
People in their network hear it immediately (zero latency)
Those who resonate surf it onward (near-zero internal resistance)
Wave propagates through trust networks in real-time
No gatekeepers. No algorithmic mediation. No institutional bottleneck.
Just: fans distributing to other fans through chains of trust.

Why This Is Revolutionary for Artists
Zero Friction Distribution
From discovery to distribution: one tap.
Someone finds your song on Bandcamp, SoundCloud, a live show. They think "my friend would love this." On Crowdsurf: tap surf. Done.
Not:
Copy link
Switch apps
Write caption
Post to Instagram story
Hope friend sees it before it disappears
Just: surf. Information propagates immediately.
The easier it is to share, the more sharing happens. The more sharing happens, the faster music propagates. The faster propagation, the more artists can reach audiences without institutional intermediaries.
Distribution speed approaches information speed.
Zero Latency Reach
Traditional distribution: weeks or months from creation to audience.
Finish song → master → release → pitch to playlist → maybe featured → maybe discovered
Crowdsurf: minutes from discovery to network.
Someone discovers you → surfs → their network sees it immediately
This changes artist strategy. You don't need to:
Build email list
Pay for playlist placement
Wait for press coverage
Accumulate followers before releasing
You need: make music worth surfing.
If your music creates waves, it reaches people. Not through your marketing. Through their networks.
The music distributes itself if it has propagation fitness.
Near-Zero Internal Resistance
Internal resistance: the psychological barrier to sharing.
On Instagram: "Should I post this? Does it fit my aesthetic? Will my followers care? Will it get engagement?"
High resistance. Carefully curated image. Most music you discover, you don't share.
On Crowdsurf: "Will this create a wave?"
Lower resistance. You're expected to surf music. Your profile is your surf history. Sharing is the core action, not a performance.
Result: people share music they believe in rather than music that fits their brand.
This helps:
Weird music (doesn't fit Instagram aesthetic but might propagate on Crowdsurf)
New artists (no social proof yet but someone believes in the music)
Genre-crossing work (doesn't fit neat categories but has cross-regional appeal)
Experimental work (risky to post but worth surfing if it's genuinely interesting)
The resistance to sharing drops because:
Surfing is expected behavior (not performance)
Wave size proves you right (status from successful curation)
Failed surfs are normal (not every surf creates a wave)
Profile shows range (you explore different regions)
Fan-to-Fan Trust Networks
Labels and algorithms are low-trust intermediaries.
Label says: "This artist is good" → Listener thinks: "Are they actually good or is this marketing?"
Algorithm says: "You might like this" → Listener thinks: "Is this actually for me or optimizing for engagement?"
Friend says: "This created a wave" → Listener thinks: "Let me hear it."
Trust networks distribute information more efficiently than broadcast or algorithmic systems because:
Signal is credible (friend stakes reputation on surf)
Context is known (you know this friend's taste)
Filtering is aligned (they surf for propagation, not profit)
When your fan surfs your music to their network, they're vouching for you. Their taste reputation transfers to you.
This is decentralized A&R. Every curator is finding artists, validating quality, introducing them to networks.
Not as business model (labels extract value). As cultural practice (curators gain status, artists gain reach, networks gain discovery).

The Small Artist Opportunity
You're a bedroom producer. Zero followers. Zero budget. Zero industry connections.
You make a song. Upload it. Someone in Latvia discovers it through Bandcamp's tag exploration. Surfs it. Three people in their network surf it. One of them has a network in Japan. Wave starts there. Someone with taste credibility in Tokyo surfs it. Their network includes people connected to underground scenes in Berlin, São Paulo, Melbourne.
Two weeks later: 300 surfs across continents. You've reached audiences you'd never reach through:
Your own promotion (you have no following)
Algorithmic recommendation (you have no engagement history)
Label promotion (you're unsigned)
Playlist placement (you have no industry connections)
You reached them because your music had propagation fitness in networks that value what you make.
This is the opportunity:
Make music that creates waves in taste networks aligned with your aesthetic.
Not music that algorithms like (catchy hooks, optimal retention curves). Not music that labels like (marketable, fits genre conventions). Music that people with taste want to surf to others who share that taste.
This is a completely different selection pressure:
Optimize for: "will someone stake their reputation on sharing this?"
Not for: "will this get streams?" or "will this get signed?"
The filter is: genuine artistic value as perceived by people whose status depends on their taste.
That's harder to game than algorithmic optimization or industry gatekeeping.

Distribution Becomes Discovery
In old models: distribution and discovery are separate.
Distribution: getting music to platforms, stores, radio
Discovery: listeners finding music through search, recommendations, playlists
In Crowdsurf: distribution is discovery.
The same action that distributes music (surfing) is the action that enables discovery (exposing others).
Every surf is simultaneously:
Distribution event (artist reaches new listener)
Discovery event (listener encounters new music)
Attribution event (exposer gets credit)
Trust signal (surf indicates quality)
This collapsing of distribution and discovery into a single action creates near-zero friction music propagation.
Compare:
Spotify: artist uploads → algorithm decides → maybe shown → maybe discovered (3-4 steps, high friction)
Crowdsurf: artist uploads → someone surfs → others see immediately (2 steps, minimal friction)
The reduction in steps and friction means:
Faster propagation
More music reaches audiences
Less dependence on platform decisions
More opportunity for small artists
The network distributes what it discovers. Discovery is distribution.

Why Labels Become Optional
Labels historically provided:
Capital: recording, production, marketing budgets
Distribution: physical pressing, retail relationships, radio promotion
Gatekeeping: validation that music is worth listeners' attention
The internet eliminated (1) and (2). Anyone can record. Anyone can upload to streaming.
But (3) remained. How do listeners find you among millions of artists?
Labels still provided: access to playlists, press, promotional infrastructure. The value proposition was discovery, not distribution.
Crowdsurf eliminates the need for (3).
Discovery happens through networks, not institutions. If your music creates waves, you reach audiences. The network validates quality through propagation, not labels through signing.
This doesn't mean labels disappear. They can still provide:
Artist development
Tour support
Synchronization licensing
Brand partnerships
But they're no longer gatekeepers. They're service providers.
Artists don't need labels to reach fans. They need to make music that creates waves.
Labels that understand this become talent scouts surfing artists to their networks. Labels that don't become obsolete.

The Economic Inversion
Current model: Artists → Labels/Platforms → Audiences
Value flows: artists create, platforms/labels extract, audiences consume
Power concentration: platforms and labels control access
Artists compete for institutional attention
Crowdsurf model: Artists → Fans → Fans → Fans...
Value flows: artists create, fans distribute, everyone discovers
Power distribution: curators gain status, artists gain reach
Artists compete for propagation fitness, not institutional approval
The economic shift:
Revenue: Still comes from streaming, shows, merch (unchanged)
Distribution: Comes from fans, not platforms (decentralized)
Discovery: Comes from waves, not algorithms (emergent)
Status: Artists gain status from wave size (measurable influence)
Curation: Fans gain status from starting waves (aligned incentives)
This creates new value flows:
Curators receive status (measurable cultural influence)
Artists receive distribution (fans become distributors)
Networks receive discovery (better music surfaces)
Platforms receive engagement (but don't control distribution)
Nobody extracts rent from distribution. Distribution is peer-to-peer. The platform enables it but doesn't gate it.

What Changes for Artists
Stop thinking: "How do I get on playlists?" Start thinking: "How do I make music that creates waves?"
Stop optimizing for: algorithms, gatekeepers, market trends Start optimizing for: propagation fitness in aligned taste networks
Stop asking: "How do I build a following?" Start asking: "How do I make music worth surfing?"
The strategy becomes:
Make exceptional music (necessary but not sufficient)
Release it where curators find it (Bandcamp, SoundCloud, your shows)
Connect with taste networks (not mass market, aligned niches)
Let it propagate (if it has wave potential, it will)
Build on waves (momentum compounds).
You're not chasing streams. 
You're chasing waves.
Making waves.
And the crowd surfs.

The Crowdsurf Thesis
