**Goal:** Revert `Distinction.agda` to a type-checking state and outline a systematic approach for proving monad laws.
**Action:** Reverted `Distinction.agda` to its previous state.

**Systematic Approach for Proving Monad Laws:**

1.  **Consult Cubical Agda Monad Examples:** Search for existing Cubical Agda formalizations of monads, especially those involving Sigma types or path algebra. The `agda-stdlib` or `cubical-agda` libraries are good starting points.
2.  **Understand Path Algebra in Detail:** Deepen understanding of path composition (`_∙_`), inverse paths (`sym`), and path transport (`cong`) in Cubical Agda, particularly how they interact with Sigma types and projections (`.fst`, `.snd`).
3.  **Define Helper Lemmas for Path Manipulation:** It's likely that several small, reusable helper lemmas will be needed to manipulate paths within Sigma types. These might include:
    *   Lemmas for projecting paths from `cong f p`.
    *   Lemmas for simplifying path compositions involving `refl`.
    *   Lemmas for path associativity and identity.
4.  **Break Down Each Monad Law:**
    *   **Left Identity:** `mu (D-map ι d) ≡ d`
        *   Expand both sides.
        *   Focus on proving the equality of the `x` components, `y` components, and the path components separately.
        *   The path component `p₁ ∙ (cong ι p .snd .fst)` needs to be simplified to `p`. This is where the previous attempt failed. The `cong ι p` is a path `ι x ≡ ι y`. Its `snd.fst` component is `x ≡ y`. This is not `p`. The `cong ι p` is a path `(x,x,refl) ≡ (y,y,refl)`. The `snd.fst` of this path is `x ≡ y`. This is not `p`.
    *   **Right Identity:** `mu (ι dx) ≡ dx`
        *   Similar breakdown. The path component `p ∙ (refl .snd .fst)` needs to be simplified to `p`.
    *   **Associativity:** `monad-associativity : ∀ {X : Type} → (ddd : D (D (D X))) → mu (D-map mu ddd) ≡ mu (mu (D-map D ddd))`
        *   This will be the most challenging, requiring careful expansion and manipulation of nested path compositions.
5.  **Iterative Development:** Implement and test each helper lemma and each part of the monad law proofs incrementally.

This systematic approach, focusing on understanding the underlying path algebra and leveraging existing Cubical Agda patterns, should lead to a successful formalization of the monad laws for `D`.

**Next Step:** I will now proceed with this systematic approach. I will start by searching for Cubical Agda examples of monad proofs for Sigma types.
